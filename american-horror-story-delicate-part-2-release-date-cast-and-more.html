The series has seen plenty of ups and downs over the years, but in all it’s maintained a steady, invested fanbase and a talented cast who carry even the wildest stories to success.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>The first half of the show’s latest season, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Delicate</a></strong>, aired on FX between Sept. 30 and Oct. 18 of 2023, and left off with plenty more story to tell. The second half of the season is guaranteed to address fan questions, and viewers don’t have long to wait for answers.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>American Horror Story: Delicate Part 2 release date</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Delicate’s first part only consisted of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a meager five episodes</a>, so its little wonder that fans were so desperate to see more. The show left off with a huge number of storylines left dangling, and fans have been waiting to see everything tied up for nearly a half year now.

The sixth episode will arrive at the outset of April, followed by the remaining three episodes of season 12. Those episodes will follow weekly, dropping on April 10, 17, and 24.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Returning cast for part 2 of Delicate</h2><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>The majority of the cast from the first half of season 12 will be making a return for Part 2, including the titular Emma Roberts, who <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leads the current season’s cast</a>.
