The narrative follows Fushi — an immortal being capable of taking the form of other creatures after their death — on his inner journey while assimilating with humankind. The protagonist’s development as the series progresses is said to be one of its best aspects, capturing even the iciest hearts.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>The anime’s first episode aired on April 12, 2021, and the season concluded on Aug. 30 of the same year. With its 20-episode run, To Your Eternity‘s first season had a phenomenal impact, entrancing viewers from all over the world with its emotionally compelling narrative. In February 2022, the series competed at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards, with nominations for Best Fantasy and Best Drama, and ended up winning the latter category.</p><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>While the second season has been confirmed for a while now, and the audience was expecting a fall release, the official date was only confirmed recently, on Sept. 6, via the anime’s Japanese <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> account, as well as on To Your Eternity‘s official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>. To tease the patiently awaiting fans, new key visuals for the anime have also been revealed, which you can find in the gallery below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/To-Your-Eternity-Poster.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/To-Your-Eternity.png><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><h2 id=h-when-and-how-to-watch-the-upcoming-season data-injectable=false>When and how to watch the upcoming season</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>To Your Eternity is officially scheduled to return with season two on Oct. 23, at 7pm JT. According to NHK’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, the anime’s Japanese broadcasting corporation, season two is set to have 20 episodes, much like the first. However, it’s not yet certain if the series will air every week up until its finale, or if it will be divided into two cours, as some fans suspect due to the manga’s pacing.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>All episodes of the first season are currently available for streaming worldwide on Crunchyroll, both in its original Japanese dub, as well as an English dubbed version. Crunchyroll has also already made known its stance on season two, with the confirmation that all new To Your Eternity episodes will be available for streaming on the platform, as they air in Japan.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=false>Considering season one’s success, expectations are very high for season two and judging by the trailer, it’s likely that To Your Eternity will keep its audience pleased. While it’s still soon for any talk regarding a possible third season, if everything does well fans can probably expect more anime content in the future, as the manga series seems nowhere close to its conclusion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tpmaxn6q%2FbrHTnqmnoaSuerSxwKymp2ViYr%2BmuMSaqp5llJbBpnnAp5tmr5iav6Z52KisZpuRo3q4rdOcn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
