Eddie Lee Long (aka Bishop Eddie Long) was born May 12, 1953 in Huntersville, North Carolina. He is the senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, a megachurch in unincorporated DeKalb County, Georgia, United States, near Lithonia.</p><p>When Long started as pastor for New Birth Church in 1987, there were 300 church members, which grew to 25,000. A best-selling author, Bishop Long’s captivating and powerful messages are captured in a number of books, including: It’s Your Time: Reclaim Your Territory for the Kingdom, The Elect Lady, I Don’t Want Delilah, I Need You, What a Man Wants, What a Woman Needs, Called to Conquer, Gladiator: The Strength of a Man and his most recent: 60 Seconds to Greatness: Seize the Moment and Plan for Success. Long is often seen in broadcast and print media as a regular contributor in interviews on CNN, national radio programs and noted news publications. On the other side of the ‘revered’ man of the cloth, however, is a laundry list of legal and personal troubles. During his tenure with New Birth Church, Long was found innocent in Senate investigations concerning the accusation that he may have profited from his church’s tax-exempt status. Bishop Eddie Long married Vanessa Griffin in 1990. After he was accused of sexually molesting young fatherless boys in the church, Vanessa filed for divorce. Almost immediately, a statement issued through New Birth’s public relations firm stated that Vanessa Long had rethought her decision and would withdraw her petition. In another turn of events, Vanessa’s attorneys later confirmed that she would indeed continue with the divorce. Civil lawsuits were also formally filed against Bishop Long alleging sexual relations with underage male members of his parish. Long has denied any wrongdoing through his attorneys and the lawsuits were settled out of court.</p><p>On February 17, 2012, one of Bishop Eddie Long’s lawyers, Lawrence Cooper, confirmed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that Vanessa Long had asked that the divorce petition (again) be dismissed. Unfortuantely, Bishop Eddie Long died on January 15, 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqZqLWwvIyem52hlWK5sLrGrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNis6Kv02aYp5xdobansYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
