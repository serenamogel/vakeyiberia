Deville and Rose were able to escape the house and call for help, and Thomas was eventually apprehended by the police.</p><p>He was charged with attempted armed kidnapping, armed burglary, and aggravated stalking. While Deville and Rose were able to escape unharmed, the incident understandably left a lasting impact on both of them.</p><p>Deville took time off from wrestling to focus on her well-being and process the experience’s trauma. In November 2020, it was reported that Deville had filed a lawsuit against Thomas.</p><p>According to her, he had caused her emotional distress and violated her privacy by leaking private photos and videos that he had obtained from her home. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and Deville has not spoken publicly about the incident in great detail.</p><p>The incident also had legal consequences for Deville herself. In January 2021, she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple battery after allegedly getting into a physical altercation with Rose at the WWE Performance Center in 2019.</p><p>According to reports, the altercation occurred after Deville made a comment about Rose’s appearance, and Rose responded by throwing a towel at her. Deville allegedly grabbed Rose by the hair and pulled her to the ground.</p><p>Deville was not arrested at the time of the incident, but the charges were filed after Rose requested a restraining order against her. Deville pleaded not guilty to the charges, and the case is still ongoing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK570qilspldmbK3tculnGaklaivqq3NZp6eppSav26tzZ1krJ2oqq6ttdOyZJqqoprAtXnAp5tmm5iWv6ixjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
