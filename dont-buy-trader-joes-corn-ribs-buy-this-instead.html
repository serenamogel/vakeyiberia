We tried them and <a href=# rel=noopener>reviewed them</a> and we just weren’t impressed. They’re super greasy and very salty. But, greasy as they are, somehow if you even slightly overcook them, they become very dry. The shape makes them hard to eat. I’m not sure why you’d buy these other than the novelty factor. Please stop buying the Trader Joe’s frozen corn ribs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-buy-this-trader-joe-s-mexican-style-roasted-corn><strong>BUY THIS: Trader Joe’s </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mexican Style Roasted Corn</strong></a></h2><p>If you’re looking to buy frozen corn from TJ’s, this is the route you should be taking. Trader Joe’s corn ribs might be viral, but their frozen, Mexican-style corn actually tastes good. First of all, the corn is cut off the cob making it extremely easy to eat and great for sharing. It comes with a “creamy, smoky sauce that melts off as the corn heats.” Additionally, it’s flavored with lime juice and cilantro. Lastly, it comes with a pack of cotija cheese for topping the dish. This would be great added to a burrito bowl (it might even improve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trader Joe’s frozen chicken burrito bowl</a>) or served alongside some grilled chicken. Once you taste this, you will never consider buying corn ribs again. In fact, you’ll forget corn ribs even exist!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJyfo8FurtSyZK2qkZmys3nJqJysZZOkv6950aKZrGWSqsZuwMeiqmahnqjBpq3DaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
