It practically brought FX into prominence among the other heavy-hitting TV outlets that are usually known for always having the best dramas to offer, season after season.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=581 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The plot of the show centered around “McNamara/Troy,” a plastic surgery clinic in Miami, headed by two doctors with personal lives that made their work often tougher than once imagined. Clients who wanted to look younger, be “bigger,” or even assist in some kind of drug smuggling ring — yes, really — went under the knife with the expectations of walking out a changed person. The complicated cast of supporting characters in their close circle of friends, family, and colleagues also added to the show’s appeal which lasted over the course of six thrilling seasons.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>The show’s success opened the door for cast members to move on to other projects after the perilous plastic surgeons stopped taking patients in 2010. But after so many touch-and-go exploits, what is the main cast of the show up to now?</p><h3 id=h-dylan-walsh-as-dr-sean-mcnamara data-injectable=false>Dylan Walsh as Dr. Sean McNamara</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DylanWalsh.jpg><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>Walsh was cast as Doctor Sean McNamara after being spotted by popular <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">television</a> producer and series creator Ryan Murphy in a coffee shop. Walsh did have a decent resume before landing what’s still the most popular role in his ongoing career. Before Nip/Tuck, he was a steady actor from the beginning of his career in the late eighties and through the nineties. He appeared in movies like Loverboy, Nobody’s Fool, and Congo, as well as TV shows such as Gabriel’s Fire, Brooklyn South, and The Twilight Zone.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>He continued to take a handful of small roles while playing Dr. McNamara and was able to gain more work from the success of Nip/Tuck after the show’s last episode. Walsh went on to star in Unforgettable, a hit police drama on CBS, for four seasons. His next notable role has been in the ongoing popular CW superhero drama Superman & Lois, as Sam Lane, the father of Lois Lane.</p><h3 id=h-julian-mcmahon-as-dr-christian-troy data-injectable=false>Julian McMahon as Dr. Christian Troy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/JulianMcMahon-1.jpg><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian McMahon</a></strong>, an Australian-American actor, had started his career in his native Australia before working primarily stateside in 1993 with a regular role on the NBC daytime soap opera Another World, followed by a main role in the crime drama Profiler.

His most notable roles on the small screen have been as Jonah in Marvel’s Runaways and most recently as FBI Special Agent Jess LaCroix in all three of CBS’ FBI drama storylines.

She first appeared in season one and continued to appear on and off in various episodes for all but the sixth and final season, even given main character status in season three.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Before appearing in this show, she started her career with voice work in the mid-1980s and continued that work into the nineties, with her most remembered performance in the children’s animated show Young Robin Hood. She would go a few years without any sort of acting until taking a side role in the western drama The Horse Whisperer in 1998. That opportunity allowed her to appear in a number of TV roles until she was cast as a regular in the Fox high school drama Boston Public for three seasons, bridging right into her role on Nip/Tuck.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>After that, Gilsig would focus a lot more on television work, appearing in several recurring roles in shows like Friday Night Lights, Heroes, Glee, and Scandal.

It was obvious and often graphic trauma that the doctors at McNamara/Troy saw all too frequently at times. The character first appeared during season two and was made the main antagonist during the third season.</p><p data-characters=391 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>Campos had originally worked in performing arts out of his native Brazil during the mid-1990s, quickly adding even more experience once he touched down in America.
