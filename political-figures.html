He served two terms, from 2009 until 2017. The son of parents from Kenya and Kansas, Obama was born and raised in Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where he was president of the Harvard Law Review. After serving on the Illinois State Senate, he was elected a U.S. senator representing Illinois in 2004.

He has six half-siblings, including half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng who he grew up with.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Obama’s Parents</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama’s father, Barack Obama Sr., was born of Luo ethnicity in Nyanza Province, Kenya. Obama Sr. grew up herding goats in Africa and eventually earned a scholarship that allowed him to leave Kenya and pursue his dreams of going to college in Hawaii.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama’s mother, Ann Dunham, was born on an Army base in Wichita, Kansas, during World War II. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dunham’s father, Stanley, enlisted in the military and marched across Europe in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/military-figures/george-patton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="General George Patton" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">General George Patton</a>’s army. Dunham’s mother, Madelyn, went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, the couple studied on the G.I. Bill, bought a house through the Federal Housing Program, and after several moves, ended up in Hawaii.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While studying at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Obama Sr. met fellow student Ann Dunham. They married on February 2, 1961, and Barack II was born six months later. As a child, Obama did not have a relationship with his father. When his son was still an infant, Obama Sr. relocated to Massachusetts to attend Harvard University and pursue a doctorate degree. Obama’s parents officially separated several months later and ultimately divorced in March 1964, when their son was 2. Soon after, Obama Sr. returned to Kenya.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1965, Dunham married Lolo Soetoro, a University of Hawaii student from Indonesia. A year later, the family moved to Jakarta, Indonesia, where Obama’s half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng was born in 1970. Several incidents in Indonesia left Dunham afraid for her son’s safety and education, so at the age of 10, Obama was sent back to Hawaii to live with his maternal grandparents. His mother and half-sister later joined them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama struggled with the absence of his father, whom he saw only once more after his parents divorced when Obama Sr. visited Hawaii for a short time in 1971. “[My father] had left paradise, and nothing that my mother or grandparents told me could obviate that single, unassailable fact,” he later reflected. “They couldn’t describe what it might have been like had he stayed.”</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Life in Hawaii<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While living with his grandparents, Obama enrolled in the esteemed Punahou School. He excelled in basketball and graduated with academic honors in 1979. As one of only three Black students at the school, he became conscious of racism and what it meant to be African American.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama later described how he struggled to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage with his own sense of self: “I noticed that there was nobody like me in the Sears, Roebuck Christmas catalog... and that Santa was a white man,” he wrote. “I went into the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror with all my senses and limbs seemingly intact, looking as I had always looked, and wondered if something was wrong with me.”</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Obama’s Half-Siblings</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama’s family includes six half-siblings located around the world. He shares a mother with half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng and has five paternal half-siblings.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/a34670164/barack-obama-siblings/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Oprah Daily" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">According to Oprah Daily</a>, he has maintained a warm and close relationship with half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng. The two grew up together and both graduated from the Punahou School. “He took his job as big brother seriously,” she said of Obama. “Our mother divorced my father, and our grandfather died. So he really ended up being the man of the house.” Soetoro-Ng campaigned for Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections, and the two have shared family vacations in Indonesia and Christmases in Hawaii.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama’s oldest paternal half-sibling, Malik Obama, was born in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1958, and the two didn’t meet until 1985. Malik <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://apnews.com/article/c3b9f806fe15da665b8412381e3f0771 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=told class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">told</a> the Associated Press in 2004 he served as the best man at Barack’s wedding and vice versa. However, Malik notably criticized Obama’s presidency in 2016 and announced his support for Republican candidate <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Donald Trump</a> in that year’s election. He attended the third presidential debate as Trump’s guest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Barack’s other half-siblings include:</p><ul data-node-id=24 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Half-sister Auma Obama, born 1960 in Nairobi.

After two years, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, graduating in 1983 with a degree in political science.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After his undergrad studies, Obama worked in the business sector for two years. He moved to Chicago in 1985, where he worked on the impoverished South Side as a community organizer for low-income residents in the Roseland and the Altgeld Gardens communities.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">It was during this time that Obama, who said he “was not raised in a religious household,” joined the Trinity United Church of Christ. He also visited relatives in Kenya and paid an emotional visit to the graves of his biological father, who died in a car accident in November 1982, and his paternal grandfather.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“For a long time, I sat between the two graves and wept,” Obama wrote. “I saw that my life in America—the Black life, the white life, the sense of abandonment I’d felt as a boy, the frustration and hope I’d witnessed in Chicago—all of it was connected with this small plot of earth an ocean away.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Returning from Kenya with a sense of renewal, Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988. The next year, he met with constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe. Their discussion so impressed Tribe that when Obama asked to join his team as a research assistant, the professor agreed. In February 1990, Obama was elected the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review. He graduated magna cum laude with his juris doctor from Harvard Law School in 1991.</p><h2 title="Marriage to Michelle Obama and Daughters" data-anchor-id=marriage-to-michelle-obama-and-daughters class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Marriage to Michelle Obama and Daughters</h2><p id=Marriage-to-Michelle-Obama-and-Daughters data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1989, while still in law school, Obama joined the Chicago law firm of Sidley Austin as a summer associate. There, he met Michelle Robinson, a young lawyer who was assigned to be his adviser. Initially, Michelle refused to date Barack, believing that their work relationship would make the romance improper. However, she relented not long after, and the couple fell in love.</p><img alt="malia obama, michelle obama, and sasha obama smile as they look various directions, malia is wearing a black and blue dress with a bow in the front, michelle is wearing a teal dress with three quarter length sleeves and a flower broach, sasha is wearing a purple top" title="Malia Obama, Michelle Obama, and Sasha Obama in 2008" width=4256 height=2832 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/michelle-obama-wife-of-democratic-presidential-candidate-news-photo-1682952827.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Malia, Michelle, and Sasha Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention</p><p id=Marriage-to-Michelle-Obama-and-Daughters data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On October 3, 1992, he and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/us-first-lady/michelle-obama data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Michelle class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Michelle</a> were married.

He also taught constitutional law part-time at the University of Chicago Law School between 1992 and 2004—first as a lecturer and then as a professor—and helped organize voter registration drives during <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bill-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bill Clinton" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Bill Clinton</a>’s 1992 presidential campaign.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama’s advocacy work led him to run for and win a seat in the Illinois State Senate as a Democrat in 1996. During his years as a state senator, Obama worked with both Democrats and Republicans to draft legislation on ethics, as well as expand health care services and early childhood education programs for the poor. He also created a state earned-income tax credit for the working poor. As chairman of the Illinois Senate’s Health and Human Services Committee, Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases after a number of death-row inmates were found to be innocent.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2000, Obama made an unsuccessful Democratic primary run for the U.S. House of Representatives seat held by four-term incumbent candidate Bobby Rush. Undeterred, he created a campaign committee in 2002 and began raising funds to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 2004. With the help of political consultant David Axelrod, Obama began assessing his prospects for a Senate win.<br></p><h2 id=Quick-Facts data-node-id=40 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Illinois Senator</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Encouraged by poll numbers, Obama decided to run for the open U.S. Senate seat, vacated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald. In the 2004 Democratic primary, he defeated multimillionaire businessman Blair Hull and Illinois Comptroller Daniel Hynes with 52 percent of the vote.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">That summer, he was invited to deliver the keynote speech in support of John Kerry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. Obama emphasized the importance of unity and made veiled jabs at the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-w-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George W.

Bush</a> administration and the diversionary use of wedge issues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After the convention, Obama returned to his U.S. Senate bid in Illinois. His opponent in the general election was supposed to be Republican primary winner Jack Ryan, a wealthy former investment banker. However, Ryan withdrew from the race in June 2004 following public disclosure of unsubstantiated sexual deviancy allegations by his ex-wife, actor Jeri Ryan. That August, diplomat and former presidential candidate Alan Keyes accepted the Republican nomination to replace Ryan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the November 2004 general election, Obama received 70 percent of the vote to Keyes’ 27 percent, the largest electoral victory in Illinois history. With his win, Obama became only the third African American elected to the U.S. Senate since Reconstruction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sworn into office on January 3, 2005, Obama partnered with Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana on a bill that expanded efforts to destroy weapons of mass destruction in Eastern Europe and Russia. Then, with Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, he created a website to track all federal spending. Obama also spoke out for victims of Hurricane Katrina, pushed for alternative energy development, and championed improved veterans’ benefits.</p><h2 title="2008 Presidential Election and Inauguration " data-anchor-id=2008-presidential-election-and-inauguration class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">2008 Presidential Election and Inauguration</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In February 2007, Obama made headlines when he announced his candidacy for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.

Because these issues were intertwined with the economic well-being of the nation, he believed all would have to be undertaken simultaneously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On November 4, 2008, Obama defeated Republican presidential nominee <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figure/john-mccain data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John McCain" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">John McCain</a>, 52.9 percent to 45.7 percent, in the popular vote and won election as the 44th president of the United States.

When he took office at age 47, Obama inherited a global economic recession, two ongoing foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the lowest-ever international favorability rating for the United States. During his inauguration speech, Obama summarized the situation by saying, “Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious, and they are many. They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America: They will be met.”</p><h2 title="First Term as U.S. President" data-anchor-id=first-term-as-us-president class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">First Term as U.S. President</h2><h2 id=Quick-Facts data-node-id=53 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">First 100 Days and Nobel Peace Prize</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama coaxed Congress to expand health care insurance for children and provide legal protection for women seeking equal pay. A $787 billion stimulus bill was passed to promote short-term economic growth in the face of the Great Recession. Housing and credit markets were put on life support, with a market-based plan to buy U.S. banks’ toxic assets. The government made loans to the auto industry, and new regulations were proposed for Wall Street.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=55 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama cut taxes for working families, small businesses, and first-time home buyers. The president also loosened the ban on embryonic stem cell research and moved ahead with a $3.5 trillion budget plan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama undertook a complete overhaul of America’s foreign policy. He reached out to improve relations with Europe, China, and Russia and to open dialogue with Iran, Venezuela, and Cuba. He lobbied allies to support a global economic stimulus package. He committed an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan and set an August 2010 date for withdrawal of nearly all U.S. troops from Iraq. (Obama was an early opponent of President George W.

The new law prohibited the denial of coverage based on preexisting conditions, allowed citizens under 26 years old to be insured under parental plans, provided for free health screenings for certain citizens, and expanded insurance coverage and access to medical care to millions of Americans.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=62 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Casually known as “Obamacare,” the hallmark legislation faced strong opposition from Congressional Republicans and the populist Tea Party movement even after its passage. In October 2013, a dispute over the federal budget and Republican desires to defund or derail the Affordable Care Act caused a 16-day shutdown of the federal government.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The rollout of the reforms were initially bumpy. October 2013 saw the failed launch of HealthCare.gov, the website meant to allow people to find and purchase health insurance. Extra technical support was brought in to work on the troubled website, which was plagued with glitches for weeks. The health care law was also blamed for some Americans losing their existing insurance policies, despite repeated assurances from Obama that such cancellations would not occur.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The legislation has faced numerous challenges in court and wound up at the U.S. Supreme Court three times. In June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate, which required citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a tax. In a 5-4 decision, the court said that the health care law’s signature provision fell within the taxation power granted to Congress under the Constitution.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the summer of 2015, the Supreme Court upheld part of the Act regarding health care tax subsidies. Without these tax credits, buying medical insurance might have become too costly for millions of people.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The latest Supreme Court decision about the Affordable Care Act began in 2017 when Congressional Republicans dropped the individual mandate tax penalty to zero. Texas and 17 other Republican states quickly sued to strike down the Affordable Care Act, mainly based on their opposition to its individual mandate. A Texas federal judge ruled in favor of the suit, saying that because there was no longer a tax, the law was unconstitutional.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The case was sent to an appeals court. A final ruling came in June 2021 when the U.S. Supreme Court <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/988837265/obamacare-wins-for-the-3rd-time-at-the-supreme-court data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=voted class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">voted</a>, 7-2, to uphold the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the objecting states were not required to pay anything under the mandate provision and thus had no standing to bring the challenge to court.

In his second inaugural address, Obama called the nation to action on such issues as climate change, health care, the federal deficit, and marriage equality. Although he made progress on some of these fronts, he also faced waning public support—his approval rating hit a low of 38 percent in September 2014, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to a Gallup poll" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">according to a Gallup poll</a>—and a divided government, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress for the final two years of Obama’s administration.</p><h2 data-node-id=81 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">NSA Wiretapping Controversy<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=82 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In June 2013, after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/activists/edward-snowden data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edward Snowden" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Edward Snowden</a> shared confidential government documents with journalists, the news broke that the National Security Agency’s surveillance program was much broader than American citizens knew. Obama defended the NSA’s email monitoring and telephone wiretapping during a visit to Germany that month. “We are not rifling through the emails of German citizens or American citizens or French citizens or anyone else,” he said. Obama stated that the program had helped stop roughly 50 threats.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=83 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, the president suffered a significant drop in his approval ratings, to 45 percent, partially due to the revelations.

Several Arab countries joined the airstrikes against the extremist group. “The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force,” Obama said in a speech to the United Nations. “So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=87 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Efforts to dismantle the Islamic State have continued after Obama’s presidency.

He spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the phone, which marked the first direct contact between the leaders of the two countries in more than 30 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=90 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This groundbreaking move by Obama was seen by many as a sign of thawing in the relationship between the United States and Iran. “The two of us discussed our ongoing efforts to reach an agreement over Iran’s nuclear program,” reported Obama at a press conference.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=91 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In July 2015, Obama announced that, after lengthy negotiations, the United States and five world powers had reached an agreement with Iran. The deal allowed inspectors entry into Iran to make sure the country kept its pledge to limit its nuclear program and enrich uranium at a much lower level than would be needed for a nuclear weapon. In return, the United States and its partners removed the tough sanctions imposed on Iran and allowed the country to ramp up sales of oil and access frozen bank accounts. That year, Obama also traveled to India and reached a civilian nuclear agreement with Prime Minister <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/narendra-modi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Narendra Modi" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Narendra Modi</a> that opened the door to U.S. investment in India’s energy industry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=92 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Elsewhere, Obama moved to reestablish diplomatic ties with Cuba in December 2014.

The policy change came after the exchange of American citizen Alan Gross and another unnamed American intelligence agent for three Cuban spies. However, the long-standing U.S. economic embargo on Cuba, instituted by President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John F.

Ultimately, the plan never took effect after facing backlash and lawsuits from business groups, companies, 27 states, and Kentucky Senator <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/mitch-mcconnell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Mitch McConnell" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Mitch McConnell</a>, who was then the Republican minority leader. In February 2019, the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, to block the plan by putting a hold on regulations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, mostly from coal power plants.

In November 2015, he was a primary player in the international COP21 summit held outside of Paris that resulted in the Paris Climate Agreement. The agreement requires all participating nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to limit the rise of global temperatures and also to allocate resources for the research and development of alternative energy sources.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=97 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama pledged that the United States would cut its emissions more than 25 percent by 2030. On October 5, 2016, the United Nations announced the Paris Climate Agreement had been ratified by a sufficient number of countries—including China and the United States, the two largest emitters of greenhouse gases—to allow it to take effect starting on November 4, 2016. But on June 1, 2017, President Donald Trump made good on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><h2 data-node-id=98 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Supreme Court Nominees</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=99 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During his presidency, Obama filled two seats in the Supreme Court: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/sonia-sotomayor data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sonia Sotomayor" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Sonia Sotomayor</a>, who was confirmed in 2009 and is the court’s first Hispanic justice, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/elena-kagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Elena Kagan" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Elena Kagan</a>, who was confirmed in 2010.

In March, the president held a press conference at the White House to present 63-year-old U.S. Court of Appeals Chief Judge Merrick Garland as his nominee for replacing the conservative stalwart. Garland was considered a moderate “consensus” candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=101 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Garland’s nomination was immediately rebuffed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and others in the Republican Party.

He expanded the country’s diplomatic relations, and the Affordable Care Act marked the biggest health care expansion since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Although he made inroads on immigration reform through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the United States continues to face a broken immigration system.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=105 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama also struggled to enact the gun control measures he hoped for, such as universal background checks and the resurrection of the federal ban on sales of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Some of the mass shootings during his time include at Sandy Hook Elementary School (20 children and six adult fatalities) in Connecticut; an Aurora, Colorado movie theater (12 fatalities); a historically Black church in Charleston, South Carolina (9 fatalities); and a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida (49 fatalities).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=106 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ever the optimist, Obama shared these parting words at his last press conference with the White House press corps:</p>“I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad. I believe tragic things happen. I think there’s evil in the world, but I think at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we’re true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time. That’s what this presidency has tried to be about. And I see that in the young people I’ve worked with.

During his oration, Obama addressed the challenges of the economy, proposed a fee for larger banks, announced a possible freeze on government spending in the following fiscal year, and spoke against the Supreme Court’s reversal of a law capping campaign finance spending.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=112 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama also challenged politicians to stop thinking of reelection and start making positive changes. He criticized Republicans for their refusal to support legislation and chastised Democrats for not pushing hard enough to get legislation passed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=113 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He also insisted that, despite obstacles, he was determined to help American citizens through the nation’s current domestic difficulties. “We don’t quit. I don’t quit,” he said. “Let’s seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.”</p><h2 data-node-id=114 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">2015 State of the Union</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=115 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his 2015 State of the Union address, Obama declared that the nation was out of recession. “America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back... know this: The shadow of crisis has passed,” he said. He went on to share his vision for ways to improve the nation through free community college programs and middle-class tax breaks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=116 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With Democrats outnumbered by Republicans in both the House and the Senate, Obama threatened to use his executive power to prevent any tinkering by the opposition on his existing policies. “We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or re-fighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got to fix a broken system,” he said. “And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=117 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">2016 State of the Union</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=118 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 12, 2016, Obama delivered what would be his final State of the Union address. Diverging from the typical policy-prescribing format, Obama’s message for the American people was centered around themes of optimism in the face of adversity, asking them not to let fears about security or the future get in the way of building a nation that is “clear-eyed” and “big-hearted.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=119 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This did not prevent him from taking thinly disguised jabs at Republican presidential hopefuls for what he characterized as their “cynical” rhetoric, making further allusions to the “rancor and suspicion between the parties” and his failure as president to do more to bridge that gap.</p><h2 data-node-id=120 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Farewell Address</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=121 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On January 10, 2017, Obama returned to his adopted home city of Chicago to deliver his farewell address. In his speech, Obama spoke about his early days in the Windy City and his continued faith in the power of Americans who participate in their democracy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=122 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He called on politicians and American citizens to come together despite their differences. “Understand, democracy does not require uniformity,” he said. “Our founders quarreled, and compromised, and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity—the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=123 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama also appealed for tolerance along racial and ethnic lines and curbing discrimination:</p>“After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. All of us have more work to do. After all, if every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and undeserving minorities, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves.“If we decline to invest in the children of immigrants, just because they don’t look like us, we diminish the prospects of our own children—because those brown kids will represent a larger share of America’s workforce. Going forward, we must uphold laws against discrimination... But laws alone won’t be enough. Hearts must change.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=126 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He quoted Atticus Finch, the main character in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/writer/harper-lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Harper Lee" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Harper Lee</a>’s To Kill a Mockingbird, asking Americans to heed the fictional lawyer’s advice: “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=127 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama concluded his farewell address with a call to action: “My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you,” he said. “I won’t stop; in fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. But for now, whether you are young or whether you’re young at heart, I do have one final ask of you as your president—the same thing I asked when you took a chance on me eight years ago. I am asking you to believe. Not in my ability to bring about change—but in yours.”<br></p><h2 title="Life After the Presidency" data-anchor-id=life-after-the-presidency class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Life After the Presidency</h2><img alt="malia obama, michelle obama, barack obama, and sasha obama smile at the camera while standing on a lawn outside the white house, sitting in front of them are their two dogs, all four family members are wearing formal attire" title="The Obama family" width=4666 height=7000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/President_Barack_Obama style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Pete Souza</span><span class="css-180xbpm eewc14j0">//</span><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Wikimedia Commons</span><p>Malia, Michelle, Barack, and Sasha Obama outside the White House with their dogs Sunny and Bo</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=130 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After leaving the White House, the Obama family moved to a home in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, D.C., to allow younger daughter Sasha to continue school there.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=131 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obama embarked on a three-nation tour in late fall 2017, meeting with such heads of state as President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/xi-jinping data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Xi Jinping" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Xi Jinping</a> of China and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India.</p><h2 data-node-id=132 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">National Portrait Gallery</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=133 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On February 12, 2018, the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery unveiled its official portraits of Barack and Michelle.

It should help us, not hurt us. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who’s willing to work.</li><li>No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another.</li><li>We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it.</li><li>I am not opposed to all wars. I’m opposed to dumb wars.<br></li><li>So don’t let anyone tell you that change is not possible. Don’t let them tell you that standing out and speaking up about injustice is too risky. What’s too risky is keeping quiet. What’s too risky is looking the other way.</li><li>Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.</li><li>I have always believed that hope is that stubborn thing inside us that insists, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that something better awaits us so long as we have the courage to keep reaching, to keep working, to keep fighting.</li><li>It is easier to start wars than to end them.</li><li>We don’t quit. I don’t quit. Let’s seize this moment to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and strengthen our union once more.</li><li>It’s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential.</li><li>What Washington needs is adult supervision.</li><li>When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.<br></li><li>You’ve shown us, Boston, that in the face of evil, Americans will lift up what’s good. In the face of cruelty, we will choose compassion.<br></li><li>If you’re walking down the right path and you’re willing to keep walking, eventually you’ll make progress.</li><li>My job is not to represent Washington to you, but to represent you to Washington.</li><li>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.</li><li>Hope—hope in the face of difficulty. Hope in the face of uncertainty. The audacity of hope! In the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation.</li><li>If we aren’t willing to pay a price for our values, then we should ask ourselves whether we truly believe in them at all.</li><li>Yes, we can. Yes, we can change. Yes, we can.</li><li>And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and fear... we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of the American people in three simple words—yes, we can.</li></ul>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
