That being said, Family Guy fanatics were notably disappointed after learning that the ninth episode of the season was the fall finale, meaning that no new episodes would be released for a while.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=169 data-injectable=false>Luckily, a brand-new release date has finally been given for the 10th episode of the season, so those wishing to tune in thankfully don’t have to wait too much longer.</p><h2 id=h-when-will-episode-10-of-season-22-be-released data-injectable=false>When will episode 10 of season 22 be released?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Family-Guy-e1708534462967.jpg><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>With the 22nd season officially underway, you’d think that overall interest and excitement in the long-running series would have wavered by now, but passionate supporters of the comedy series have seemingly remained by its side.
