You may get the&nbsp;sense that there was chaos behind the scenes, and stuff that was staged and&nbsp;shot with the intention of having it&nbsp;play out full-length&nbsp;had to get pulverized and reconstituted in the editing&nbsp;to make the totality work for audiences and exhibitors. The narrated-by-Aquaman&nbsp;opening montage plays like an attempt to shave 20 minutes off the&nbsp;running time and&nbsp;get scene-setting and expository throat-clearing&nbsp;out of the way so the movie could&nbsp;jump ahead to the bits&nbsp;with&nbsp;the brothers getting in and out of&nbsp;trouble and working through their relationship issues while toppling statues, punching giant bugs. and zapping people with laser guns.&nbsp;</p><p>"How many influences&nbsp;do you think they referenced in this?" my viewing companion asked afterward. I&nbsp;wouldn't dare&nbsp;offer&nbsp;a number,&nbsp;but the film is upfront about its fondness for "<a href=#>Star Wars</a>,"&nbsp;<a href=#>Jules Verne</a>, H.P. Lovecraft, Peter Jackson's&nbsp;"Lord of the Rings" trilogy, the "Matrix" films (in particular, the sentinel bots) and the works of H.G. Wells (one spectacular extended&nbsp;action scene is built around Arthur and Orm trying to fend off a "<a href=#>War of the Worlds</a>"-like&nbsp;tripod machine).&nbsp;We follow the duo through a dazzling variety of settings, including the aforementioned necropolis, which Wan has said is modeled on Mario Bava's "Planet of the Vampires," and a&nbsp;secret underwater&nbsp;lair constructed from the wrecks of pirate ships, and a volcanic&nbsp;island full of green-goo-mutated flora and fauna that's like something Ray Harryhausen would have stop-motion animated in the '60s (the Harryhausen showcase "Mysterious Island," based on H.G. Wells's novella,&nbsp;is a charming fantasy adventure that's perfect for young kids, by the way).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46aqK6ZnZa7bq3NnWStoJViubC%2F02aioqaXmbyuecyoraKdXaeyt7XEsGRraGJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
