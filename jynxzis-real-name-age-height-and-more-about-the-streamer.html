Simple, he is the popular Twitch streamer who came out of nowhere to dethrone the platform’s biggest streamers with a huge jump in active subscribers that boosted him well ahead of the competition.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=74 data-current-count=74 data-injectable=false>But, who is Jynxzi, and what else do we know about the new king of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>?</p><h2 id=h-jynxzi-s-age-and-height data-injectable=false>Jynxzi’s age and height</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>https://www.instagram.com/p/CxGsF_Bv2k7/</figure><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>The famous Twitch streamer was born on Sept. 26, 2001, making him 22 years old at the time of writing. He is 5 ft 10, which the streamer confirmed himself on camera after fans claimed that he was closer to 5 ft 2.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>In the video, Jynxzi shows his height as well as his weight (which is 162.9 pounds, if you were curious). While the latter is obviously subject to fluctuations, his height probably hasn’t changed.</p><h2 id=h-what-else-do-we-know-about-jynxzi data-injectable=false>What else do we know about Jynxzi?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/p/CtVZTsktNc-/</figure><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>Not a great deal is known about Jynxzi’s private life, but we know his real name is Nicholas Stewart and that he was born in Washington. Back in 2021, he was asked if he had a girlfriend to which he responded, “I don’t have a girlfriend bro. I play Siege all day.” Thus, by all accounts, it seems like Jynxzi is currently single.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>Jynxzi has a pretty impressive estimated net worth of about $725,000, most of which comes from Twitch, and that number is probably only set to grow considering he is the most subscribed streamer on the platform.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>Before Twitch, Jynxzi claims he was heavily involved in esports for a couple of years, playing Clash Royale professionally as a teen.</p><h2 id=h-jynxzi-s-rise-to-fame data-injectable=false>Jynxzi’s rise to fame</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>https://www.instagram.com/p/CpB1y8jtw9H/</figure><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Jynxzi rose to popularity on Twitch mostly for playing Rainbow Six Siege. He started in 2019 by making comedic and competitive gaming videos of multiplayer games. He eventually became a Twitch partner as well as expanded into YouTube before really starting to grow his audience in 2020.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>Success came to Jynxzi pretty fast, mostly thanks to his unique content and personality, it’s also been helped by the fact that he’s managed to avoid controversy, something which seems to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">always happen with big streamers</a>. Jynxzi has remained drama-free and continues to create quality content for his fans, so it makes sense that he would be one of the most popular content creators on the site.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>He overtook the likes of XQC and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Cenat (the previous king of Twitch)</a> as the streamer with the most active subscribers back in April, a development he became aware of while streaming. Since then, he’s continued to grow at a rapid pace and now he’s got a pretty sizeable lead with nearly 130,000, putting him almost 50,000 ahead of his closest competition.</p><p data-characters=124 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true>With numbers like that, it’s safe to say Jynxzi will probably stay the number one Twitch streamer for quite some time.</p><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=61 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 7 Best DSLR Cameras for Streaming</a> on Dot Esports</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeXlrqqusZoobKmqK%2B2tHnRnpilZZ6WuqZ5wKCcZqCVnrSpwIyapZ1lnaS%2FpnnAm6aurF2ptaZ50q2pnpmdmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
