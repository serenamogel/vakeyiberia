He has made a name for himself for shaping the American fashion landscape and for being with it during times of change—and it's something he continues to do, which brings us to his show tonight when he unveiled that his brand was the latest to adopt the "buy now, wear now" model, allowing his customers the opportunity to buy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>the brand's "September Collection"</a> (a second fall collection in addition to the one he showed earlier in February) right off the runway. From staging his show right outside the Ralph Lauren Mansion on N.Y.C.'s Madison Avenue to recruiting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kendall Jenner</a> to model, read on for the top nine moments that went down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1</strong>. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ralph Lauren</a> introduced a second fall collection that customers were able to shop immediately <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>after its runway debut</a>. "Today, I am proud to share with you, for the first time ever, my new women's collection right off the runway and into your lives. For me, this is the ultimate expression of luxury—offering you every look, every accessory, every handmade detail immediately in my flagship stores around the world and online," read the show notes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2</strong>. And to encourage the "buy now" mentality, it was fitting that he chose to set up shop (pun intended) right outside his Madison Avenue flagship on the Upper East Side, closing down two city blocks to build a runway under a see-through tent, complete with four tiers of cushioned seating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3</strong>. As the most in-demand model in town, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kendall Jenner</a> is pretty much a runway veteran at this point, but the reality star still has her firsts. She made her Ralph Lauren debut (which the brand hinted at via Insta prior to show time), closing the show in a badass leather jacket over a white shirt and styled with a statement necklace, a Western-inspired belt, and tailored pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4</strong>. Jenner was joined on the runway by other big-name models: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella Hadid</a> and Liya Kebede.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Slaven Vlasic/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>5</strong>. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Julianne Moore</a> brought her 14-year-old look-alike daughter Liv Freundlich and made a mother-daughter date night out of the Ralph Lauren show, twinning it up in little black dresses.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jamie McCarthy/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>6</strong>. And they were joined by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jessica Alba</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a> in the front row.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>7</strong>. The beauty look featured a sun-kissed glow and a hint of glamour.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>8</strong>. The September Collection took on a Western-inspired theme, but with tailored elements catered to the modern-day working woman. There were high-shine minis with beaded Southwestern patterns, shimmery cut-out sequined gowns in rainbow-y shades, and an abundance of studded leather chokers, fringe, giant belts, and cowboy hats.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>9</strong>. After Ralph Lauren made his usual lap on the runway (this time with a little jig), the curtains of the RL flagship window display were drawn open, unveiling a display of the new offering, all available for purchase right then and there (and at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>ralphlauren.com</a>). Convenient, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wLCYq5yjYrK3sc2tqmiekai1qrvNZq6enZtkv6K4z6FkpZmlp7KvedKep62dnZeys3nCqKOlnZOptrC6jKewn68%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
