Having an eight-man tag team match can sometimes mean for a messy bout, this was a controlled chaos that ran like clockwork.</p><p>Punk was a standout here, especially with a visceral response from the crowd, but Ricky Starks was also given a lot of time to shine in too. It was a very fun match and it stretched on for well over 20 minutes, but all involved helped it to tick along well.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-dax-harwood-dynamite-3-23-2022><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>CM Punk Vs.

The pair had several fluid and smooth exchanges, and for fans of pure in-ring work, you couldn’t take your eyes off this one.</p><p>Due to a lack of stakes this didn’t reach a higher level, but overall it was a wonderfully wrestled match and is certainly up there with Punk’s best in AEW. The finishing sequence with Punk countering a sharpshooter into an anaconda vice was a great way to close out this one.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-samoa-joe-all-in-2023><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>CM Punk Vs.

Seeing Sting and CM Punk team up was surreal, and it led to the match having a special buzz.</p><p>It was a long match which went through several twists and turns, and the whole story of MJF trying to duck and dodge Punk was very entertaining. This will go down as one of the <a href=#>most memorable matches of Punk’s time in AEW for sure</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jon-moxley-vs-cm-punk-all-out-2022><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jon Moxley Vs.

The false finish near the start of the match was a great way to kick things off, and the pair had the crowd in the palm of their hands. Moxley’s heelish nature was wonderfully done, and it allowed Punk to fight from below as a valiant babyface, fighting through the pain of his injured foot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-mjf-dynamite-2-2-2022><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>CM Punk Vs.

Time flew by due to world class storytelling, with MJF playing the conniving and cheating heel and CM Punk going on the offensive as a fearless hometown hero.</p><p>Punk’s selling of his arm and leg were great, and MJF’s psychology targeting Punk’s limbs was world class. The false finish followed up by MJF winning for a second time in one match was a massive shock too. This is up there with the best Dynamite main events ever.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-eddie-kingston-full-gear-2021><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>CM Punk Vs.
