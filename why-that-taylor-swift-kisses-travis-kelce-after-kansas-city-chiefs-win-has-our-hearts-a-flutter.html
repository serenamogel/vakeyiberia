After a big win against the Los Angeles Chargers during Sunday Night Football, Kelce and his Kansas City Chiefs teammates celebrated a game well played, and the tight end blushed as Swift gave him a surprise kiss in a photo op.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=558 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>Kelce’s teammate, Mecole Hardman Jr., posed alongside the football player, and Hardman’s girlfriend, Chariah, and Swift were also in the pictures. Chariah cemented the moment into internet history forever with a few snaps of their celebration, and in the first, the couples are all smiles; it’s the second snap, however, that really got people talking. Swift and Kelce are clearly an item, but you can’t hate on Swift fans for feeling like today is a fairytale after seeing a sweet kiss on the cheek snap of the powerhouse of a pair.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by People Magazine (@people)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Be still our beating hearts; this cheek kiss is everything — and to be honest, we love seeing Swift this happy. Not only is she living her best life, she got the guy, the guy who acts like being with her is the honor of a lifetime, and our romantic hearts couldn’t help but skip a beat at that.</p><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Hear us out; we know that some football fans are growing quite tired of hearing all the Swift/Kelce stuff, but let me counter that with one simple idea: can’t we let people be happy? They’re young, talented, working hard to chase their dreams, and committed to their success; they’re also quite gorgeous as individuals and as a pair, and they seem totally smitten with one another. Shouldn’t we just say good for them and let them have found joy together?</p><p data-characters=516 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>Me, I’m a Bengals fan. Joey B is my guy, so I’ve never quite been on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiefs train</a> myself, but being a fan of Taylor Swift? That I am, and in being a fan of hers for so long, as many would agree, it’s safe to say that she seems happier than ever, excited by the idea of Kelce and their semi-public dates and pictures in frames with kisses on cheeks. Sign me up. I am all for someone getting their happily ever after or even their happily right now; Swift deserves it. <strong>Call this her Smitten Era.</strong></p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Chariah shared a few pics of the couples, plus one of herself and Swift, and we are living for it. They’re rocking the supportive beau look well, and their guys? They look thrilled to have their support and to be in their presence, rightfully so. Chariah and Taylor are stunning!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Chariah Gordon (@chariah_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=276 data-injectable=false>Swift being open about her new romance is giving us butterflies, and if we may quote Swift herself, we’re feeling like things are a little bit…lyrical right now.
