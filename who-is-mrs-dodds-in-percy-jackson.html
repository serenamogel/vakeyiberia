This was expected from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a story that relies so heavily on Greek mythology</a>, and yet, some strange characters still manage to surprise us. One of the most suspicious, and to some degree intriguing, is Mrs. Dodds (Megan Mullally).</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>At the beginning of the story, she looks like an ordinary teacher. I mean, she doesn’t strike us as a particularly kind teacher to Percy (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Walker Scobell</a>), but at least she has a human appearance. Still, something about her demeanor feels odd right off the bat, leaving the audience to question what her true intentions are. Well, they don’t have to question for too long.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-mrs-dodds-real-identity-in-the-percy-jackson-series data-injectable=false>What is Mrs. Dodds’ real identity in the Percy Jackson series?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/percy-jackson-and-the-olympians-alecto.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Mrs. Dodds’ real name is Alecto, and no, she’s not a human teacher, but a mythical creature known as a Fury. She serves at the command of Hades, the god of the underworld, and acts as a minor antagonist in The Lightning Thief, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first book in the Percy Jackson series</a>.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>Tasked by Hades with retrieving his Helm of Darkness and Zeus’ master bolt, Alecto departs in search of Percy. Because he’s the one believed to have stolen those items, the Fury poses as a teacher at the boy’s school. As soon as she’s certain that Percy is who she’s looking for, she sheds her human persona and attacks him, revealing her true colors.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=192 data-injectable=false>In the grand scheme of things, Mrs. Dodds isn’t a major threat to Percy. However, that doesn’t mean one should let their guard down around her, especially when she has a job to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnafAbrDOnZusZZmjerGx0ZywZqKRmLi0u81o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
