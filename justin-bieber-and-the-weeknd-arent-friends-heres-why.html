For Gomez, it could have meant getting back at Bieber, who began dating Sofia Richie the previous summer. The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, Bella Hadid, also didn't react well to the news. "[Bella] is hurt and pissed that [The Weeknd has] moved on so quickly with Selena," a source told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>At the time, there was some petty jealousy involved on both ends. When The Weeknd was snapped kissing Gomez in January 2017, Bieber slammed The Weeknd's music, telling <a href=#>TMZ</a> it was "whack." About a month later, he further shaded his nemesis on Instagram Live when he said that his favorite song of the moment was The Weeknd's "Starboy," via <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. He wasn't being sincere, though. Just after making the claim, Bieber burst out laughing. His friend, Director Alfredo Flores said, "Oh s***, that was funny," and Bieber echoed the statement before ending the live video. Also telling: Bieber opted to skip The Grammys that year, where The Weeknd was a performer. Coincidence?</p><p>Of course, The Weeknd wasn't above throwing shade, either. His song "Some Way" — which he dropped in February 2017 — featured NSFW <a href=#>lyrics</a> that seem to be pointed at Bieber, including, "I think your girl fell in love with me / She say my f*** and tongue game a remedy."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlnZ4F5f46jrKysmaN6o7XEm5yrZZGjsW7Ax55ksJ2VoLulecCrnKesXZu%2FqrHNnapmoJWnsrR51qGwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
