Some people criticized the former Alaska Governor for a meme posted on Instagram. They believe it demeans people with Down Syndrome.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In October 2018, Palin, whose then-10-year-old son, Trig, has Down syndrome, shared the picture suggesting that Democrats are viewed as spoilt children.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was done amid ongoing protests against Brett Kavanaugh, an American lawyer and jurist who had been alleged of sexual assault, and his nomination to the Supreme Court.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The meme intended to contrast how protesters think they appear and how they really appear, including photos of a boy with Down Syndrome crying.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Palin did not initially identify the boy in the photo as her son, Trig. There were mixed reactions from the online audience.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sarah-Palin-down-syndrome-meme.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>One person, who defended Palin’s meme, wrote, “That’s her kid; she doesn’t look at him as disabled. She was just making a point about people acting like little kids!”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another person wrote, “She can’t show a picture of her son crying like a baby? All I see is a little boy fussing in a store.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>However, not everyone was on the same page. Several people accused Palin of mocking people with the disorder.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>One person commented: “Why would you compare this to your developmentally delayed son? What is wrong with you?”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Another, who was not pleased, wrote, “This is a disgrace and demeans all developmentally disabled.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>At the same time, some were clueless and did not know how to feel, with one writing, “I love you, Sarah, but I don’t get it.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It was doubtful that Palin meant offense since she has a son with the Syndrome and has also been outspoken about her support for people and children with the condition.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>She also criticized a 2010 episode of&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Family Guy</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;regarding a character with Down syndrome.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Explore More</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>:&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel=noopener><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Jodi Arias Mugshot: Is Travis Alexander Girlfriend In Jail?
