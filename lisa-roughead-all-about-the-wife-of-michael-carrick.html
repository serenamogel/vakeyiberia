Lisa is the vice-chairperson of the Michael Carrick Foundation (@michaelcarrickfoundation), a charitable organization that provides empowerment chances to underprivileged young people in Tyne and Wear and Greater Manchester. Carrick’s kit bag was created by the foundation to offer participants materials to keep them warm and safe over the winter.</p><h2>Her tweets in support of her marriage became viral.</h2><p>Lisa has been Carrick’s rock throughout his life. She has been there for her spouse from the beginning of his profession. She is constantly ready to defend her husband from the insults heaped on Michael as a loving wife.&nbsp;Carrick was chastised by Roy Keane for his performance during Manchester United’s 2-0 defeat against Olympiakos in 2014.</p><p>He was further chastised during his post-match interview, in which Keane noted that the interview, like the performance, was lifeless.&nbsp;He also said that some of the players on the field should never play for the club again. Lisa was outraged by the insults made against Michael and quickly defended him, saying,</p><p>“What a ****, Roy Keane says anything to get a response.&nbsp;That’s all… You’re done.”</p><p>Soon after, she erased her tweet and tweeted again, notifying her followers that she had removed her tweet and added,</p><p>“My emotions got the best of me…I’m just disappointed.”</p><h2>She was there for her spouse amid his despair.</h2><p>Lisa is one of those wonderful spouses that is always there for her husband in good and bad times.&nbsp;She was there for Michael when he was depressed after his championship final loss in Rome in 2009. The sentiment that he was responsible for the loss badly impacted him, leading to sadness, and no one was aware of his melancholy save his parents, brother Graham, and Lisa until he exposed it in his book later in 2018.&nbsp;According to him, he felt as if he was in mourning after the loss in Rome, and when he was left out at the start of the next season, the worry of being sold deepened.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Lisa-Roughead-3.jpg alt="Lisa Roughead" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He thought that his header, which was wayward and resulted in Barca’s first goal, would not be forgiven.&nbsp;When he was chosen to represent England in the 2010 World Cup, he did not feel like participating and even told Lisa about his feelings.&nbsp;He believed he was not good enough to compete in the World Cup.&nbsp;Carrick was going through a bad period. However, he emerged from it in late 2010, and he has never looked back since.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Lisa’s net worth is currently being calculated. We currently know the net worth of her husband, Carrick.&nbsp;Carrick had a fantastic playing career. He has five Premier League championships, three League Cups, an FA Cup, the Champions League, and the Europa League to his name.</p><p>He guided Manchester United to win in his debut game as caretaker manager. Following the resignation of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on November 21, 2021, Carrick was appointed caretaker manager. He has accumulated an incredible wealth of $16.5 million, as of August 2023, during his football career.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Wife</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Lisa Roughead</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijoquRYr%2BwwcahnJqcXZa5rXnAm6aurF2ptaZ51qKdnmWfm3qutcKhmJ6kXZius77InKJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
