I like films with very specific senses of place, with characters who are defiantly individual, with plots that are impossible to anticipate. There is the suggestion that "Love Serenade" will be some kind of a love triangle, with both sisters competing for the disc jockey's attention--but something about Ken Sherry's implacable, insolent, lazy personality suggests that he has secrets we have not even remotely guessed.</p><p>Australian films love to create strange characters. Movies such as "<a href=#>Sweetie</a>," "<a href=#>Muriel's Wedding</a>" and "<a href=#>Strictly Ballroom</a>" were populated by people whose lives seem made out of pop fantasies and sheer desperation. The Hurley girls are like that. Vicki-Ann (<a href=#>Rebecca Frith</a>) works in a hair saloon (the Hairport), and Dimity (<a href=#>Miranda Otto</a>) is a waitress at the downtown Chinese restaurant, where the owner, Albert Lee (<a href=#>John Alansu</a>), sings "Wichita Lineman" in a mournful baritone. When Ken Sherry walks into the restaurant, Dimity breathlessly blurts out, "Excuse me for interfering, but my sister Vicki-Ann is looking for a boyfriend and we live right next door to you!" Sherry regards her Dimity like a specimen on a microscope slide: "What about you? Are you looking for a boyfriend?"</p><p>She is. Their seduction scene is the least erotic in the history of movies. They discuss whether fish have souls, and if they can go to heaven. He speaks about how lonely he is. She offers to ease his loneliness. He remains so impassive that his seduction technique seems to involve challenging women to make him notice them. (The long-faced George Shevtsov plays the character with such snaky detachment that even while we're watching this film we want to see him in others.)</p><p>Vicki-Ann, who believes the theory that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach, has adopted the casserole method of seduction, and is shattered to learn that her kid sister has scored first, using more direct methods. But soon both sisters have enjoyed, or endured, or survived, Ken Sherry's charms. And, peering out from behind their blinds or peeking over the backyard fence, they remain fascinated by his lifestyle. What does he do in there? What is he like?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpq%2BdXaiys7HNmpueZWFuhng%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
