In training camp with the Kansas City Chiefs during the 2018 season, a leg injury hindered his opportunity to make the 53-man roster. After going and dominating in the short lived Alliance of American Football in the spring, he returned to the Chiefs and their depleted cornerback group, hoping to make the team.</p><p>However, a likely Achilles’ injury appears to have eliminated that chance. As big of a bummer as that is, the Chiefs now have an opportunity to find another player to contribute to the organization in either the short or long-term, or perhaps both.</p><p>We will start looking at some young players that could fill the role of Keith Reaser, whether it be young players, perhaps undrafted free agents still looking for a home, or late-round selections the Chiefs could trade for.</p><p>Perhaps, with the development of both Byron Pringle and the drafting of Mecole Hardman, fourth-year receiver Demarcus Robinson could be moved in an effort to acquire a cover corner.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keith-reaser-net-worth></span><span><strong>Keith Reaser Net Worth</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Current Contract</strong></p><table class="contract current-contract player-new"><tr><th class=year><h6>Year</h6></th><th class="age mobile_drop"><h6>Age</h6></th><th class="base-salary mobile_drop"><h6>Base Salary</h6></th><th class="prorated-bonus mobile_drop"><h6>Prorated Bonus</h6></th><th class="regular-roster-bonus mobile_drop"><h6>Roster Bonus</h6></th><th class="workout-bonus mobile_drop tablet_drop"><h6>Work out Bonus</h6></th><th class=cap-number><h6>Cap</h6><h6>Number</h6></th><th class="cap-percentage mobile_drop"><h6>Cap %</h6></th><th colspan=2><h6>Dead Money & Cap Savings</h6>Cut (pre-June 1)Cut (post-June 1)Trade (pre-June 1)Trade (post-June 1)RestructureExtension</th></tr><tbody><tr><td>2019</td><td class=mobile_drop>28</td><td class=mobile_drop>$720,000</td><td class=mobile_drop>$50,000</td><td class=mobile_drop>$25,000</td><td class="mobile_drop tablet_drop">$25,000</td><td><strong>$820,000</strong></td><td class=mobile_drop>0.4%</td><td class="player-transactions player-dead-money cut">$50,000</td><td class="player-transactions player-cap-savings cut">$770,000</td></tr></tbody><tr><td>Total</td><td class=mobile_drop>$720,000</td><td class=mobile_drop>$50,000</td><td class=mobile_drop>$25,000</td><td class="mobile_drop tablet_drop">$25,000</td><td>$820,000</td></tr></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=keith-reaser-life></span><span><strong>Keith Reaser Life</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The late Sean Taylor is Reaser’s cousin, Sean played for the Washington Redskins and served as an inspiration to Reaser.
