That’s where the inspiration came from, NOT THE CRACKHEAD you knucklehead writer. GET IT RIGHT,!!”</p><p>Check out his post below:</p><p><a class=underline-link href=#>The “crackhead” clock story originated from a recent interview</a> that Flavor Flav did with fellow Hip Hop icon <a class=underline-link href=#>Roxanne Shanté</a> for her SiriusXM show, Have a Nice Day.</p><p>The interview, which took place on Thursday (July 6), featured Flav explaining the origins of his now-infamous fashion accessory.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“So one day, as a joke, as a joke, you know, this crackhead came through my projects, you know what I’m saying? Selling these shower clocks that she stole from a place called Fortunoff,” Flavor Flav began.</p><p>“Well, she went to Fortunoff, stole this big bag, big box of shower clocks came through our projects selling them. So my boy, Son of Berserk, you know what I’m saying? He took the stopwatch off my neck and put the clock around my neck and everybody was laughing. It was a big joke and all of that.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “So they dared me to wear that clock on stage, but during the show. So when we went to open up for the Beastie Boys in Passaic, New Jersey, 1986, I wore the clock, Roxanne, and then the next day on the front page of Newsday, New York Times, New York Post, the look of the clock was dope.”</p><p>Since Public Enemy’s inception in the mid-1980’s, Flavor Flav has worn all types of clocks made from all shapes, colors, and sizes with every outfit. He even has a clock he wore on display in the <a href=# rel=noopener>National Museum of African American History & Culture</a>.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/01/flavor-flav-admits-he-spent-over-2k-a-day-on-drugs-for-six-years-straight-250x142.jpg alt="Flavor Flav Admits He Spent Over $2K A Day On Drugs For 'Six Years Straight'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Flavor Flav Admits He Spent Over $2K A Day On Drugs For 'Six Years Straight'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>January 31, 2023</p></a><p>Meanwhile, in other Flavor Flav news, the Public Enemy legend <a class=underline-link href=#>celebrated an important sobriety milestone last month</a>.</p><p>Back in June, the “Fight the Power” artist took to Instagram to share the special moment with his fans, revealing that he’s been cigarette-free for the past three years — after smoking since he was six years old.</p><p>“IMPORTANT!! I’ve changed. Today I am 3 years clean from cigarettes that I started smoking when I was just 6 years old,” he began. “Soon I’ll be 3 years sober from alcohol. And I’ve been 15+ years sober from drugs. I’m proud to share my sobriety journey, and Thankx to my friends and family and those who support me.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“To everyone out there struggling with addiction, it is a real battle you fight every day. But I’m still here, and you know what, I DID IT, and if I can do it, anyone can do it!!! To every media outlet that tries to capitalize on my goodwill trending topics and bring up my past or old interviews for sensational clickbait headlines, do better and bring up my future.”</p><p>He added: “Allow for people to grow and change in a supportive manner, and Don’t let anyone hold you to your past, I wear the clock, my clock goes clockwise, not counterclockwise, Look forward, not backwards.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0midpZmmpL9ussuarWabopawrLTEmptmm5yksKx50q2mq7FdmLmivsifoJ6c</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
