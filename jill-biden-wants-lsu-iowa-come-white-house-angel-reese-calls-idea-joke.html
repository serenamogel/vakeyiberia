But, you know, I’m going to tell Joe I think Iowa should come, too, because they played such a good game.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph"><a href=#>According to CNN</a>, the first lady’s press secretary said that only LSU was being invited to the White House.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Vanessa Valdivia said in a <a href=#>tweet</a> that the first lady’s comments “were intended to applaud the historic game and all women athletes. She looks forward to celebrating the LSU Tigers on their championship win at the White House.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">While Reese, who was named the NCAA Tournament’s Most Outstanding Player following her 15-point, 10-rebound game, posted her opinion of Biden’s idea, she has been the subject of social media comments and arguments after she mimicked <a href=#>John Cena’s</a> “You can’t see me” move by waving her hand across her face while staring at Iowa’s Caitlin Clark during the championship game.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The move was nothing new to Clark — she had made the same gesture during the Elite Eight game against Louisville.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Reese followed Clark around the court Sunday near the end of the game doing the move and pointing to her finger, presumably referencing the championship rings teams get when they win a collegiate national championship.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Reese defended her actions following the game as people began to comment on them.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“All year I was critiqued about who I was. I don’t fit the narrative,” Reese told reporters Sunday. “I don’t fit in the box that y’all want me to be in. I’m too hood. I’m too ghetto. Y’all told me that all year. But when other people do it, y’all don’t say nothing. So this is for the girls that look like me, that want to speak up for what they believe in. It’s unapologetically you. And that’s what I did it for tonight. It was bigger than me tonight.”</p><p>Latest trending news:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL%2FOnKuvZpOkunC6xLCqaKyimrultc2gZqOhnKF6o7XDnqVmr5GjwbR5y6ysZqGfrK5ur86mnGavmJ7BpnnHqKysnV2Wu6ixy2apnp2jmnqkrculqmahlJqubrbOpJxokYJ4hHSYqHBtf3yIj5eXm7FtiZFrfIKVjYCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
