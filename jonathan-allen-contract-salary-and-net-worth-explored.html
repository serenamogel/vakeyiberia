He participated in all 14 games as a sophomore in 2014, making 12 starts. He made 33 tackles and 5.5 sacks, earning first-team All-SEC honors. The Crimson Tide won the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating the Clemson Tigers by a score of 45-40 with Allen starting all 14 of their games as a junior in 2015. For his efforts during the 2016 campaign, Allen went on to receive the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, and Lombardi Award.</p><p>Allen was predicted by some NFL draft experts to go in the top five after graduating from Alabama. Teams became concerned when he was found to have arthritis in one of his shoulders and underwent surgery on both two weeks before the combine, which caused his stock to drop. He was rated as the best defensive tackle by NFLDraftScout.com, Pro Football Focus, and Sports Illustrated. After Myles Garrett, he was ranked as the second-best defensive lineman by ESPN. Analysts and scouts predicted Allen to be a first-round pick despite the arthritis diagnosis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kt7C6wK2fmqZdlrmtsc1mmqimpKeupMCMrJilmaKueqK6w2alnqxdrLyzwMdmnLGonKS%2FprCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
