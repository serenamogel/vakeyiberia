You heard right. If I could only eat one ingredient for the rest of my life, it would be onion. I think it is a miracle that so much flavor can be contained in one orb that grows underground. And surprise! Since I love onions, I love French onion dip.</p><p>This creamy, rich, oniony <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">potato chip</a> accoutrement is easily one of my favorite dips in the world when done correctly. In my opinion, store bought French onion dip should taste like caramelized onions, not just onions in general. That’s what sets this delicious dip apart. Since I’m an onion expert, I tried every French onion dip I could find at the grocery store over the course of two separate taste tests to see which ones are worthy of your next party spread or movie night on the couch. Our list may surprise you, but just trust us!</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_FRENCH-ONION_INSET_05-REDUCED.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Classic</p><strong>Lay’s French Onion Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>If you’re looking for the best classic French onion dip, Lay’s from the jar is what you should be buying. It is the sort of traditional French onion dip you can imagine being part of a party spread in the 1950s, and still holds up today. It’s savory, oniony, salty, and super affordable. Make sure to note that this is the jarred version. It’s not as good as the metal can of Frito-Lay French Onion Dip, but it’s still really good. Plus, it has the delicious flavor of nostalgia, making it one of the best store bought French onion dip brands we tried.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best store bought french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_FRENCH-ONION_INSET_04-REDUCED.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Vegan</p><strong>Hope Foods Cashew & Almond French Onion Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>Hope Foods Cashew & Almond French Onion Dip is one of the best French onion dip brands we tried because it’s so interesting and unique. Unlike many other vegan versions of French onion dip, this doesn’t try to fake dairy. It’s not super creamy or rich. Instead, it does its own thing, and we love that. It has the rich caramelized onion flavor that you expect, and then a hint of nuttiness from the cashew and almond. It has lots of textural interest. It’s chunky in a way that’s similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pesto</a> and it’s very pleasing. This is one of the most interesting and best French onion dip varities for vegans and non-vegans alike.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best store bought french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_FRENCH-ONION_INSET_03-REDUCED.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Fresh</p><strong>Dean’s French Onion Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>To me, Dean’s is more like fresh onion dip than French onion dip; however, it is delicious nonetheless. You don’t get that caramelized taste that’s common to French onion dip, so leave your expectations at the door. Instead, this is more like the packet of ranch dip you make at home with sour cream. It’s very, very tasty and creamy and fresh. It almost gives the impression it’s made with fresh scallions rather than the white or yellow onions in French onion dip is traditionally made with. You should buy this, but prepare yourself for something different than you’re used to. That being said, it’s the best onion dip for dunking veggies or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pizza</a>.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="store bought french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_FRENCH-ONION_INSET_02-REDUCED.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Budget</p><strong>Frito Lay French Onion Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Walmart</a><p>Before you lay into me for choosing this dip from a metal can over so many of the fancy refrigerated dips out there, just listen. This simply tastes better! It tastes more French onion-y than so many other dips we tried. It’s savory and packed with umami. This would be a great sandwich spread or sauce for rotisserie chicken. It’s super cheap. You can literally buy this at a gas station. What’s not to love about a delicious, affordable, accessible dip? Frito-Lay French Onion Dip, you will always have a place in my heart as one of the best French onion dips of all time.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/RANKING_FRENCH-ONION_INSET_01-REDUCED.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best Runner-Up</p><strong>Good & Gather Classic Onion Dip</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Target</a><p>Target’s Good & Gather Classic Onion Dip blew us away. It’s easily one of the best French onion dip options we tried. Honestly, it is one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best dips</a> we’ve had in general. This tastes homemade in the best way possible. It’s super thick and creamy, and tastes more like cream cheese than sour cream, which is heavenly. Onion flavor and onion pieces are prominent throughout. You could put this out at a party and people would think you made it and that you’re an amazing cook. Take advantage of that! Lie to your friends and family!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best french onion dip" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/RANKING-UPDATE_FRENCH-ONION-DIP_INSET-06.jpg data-object-fit=cover sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best of the Best</p><strong>La Terra Fina Caramelized Onion with Roasted Garlic Dip & Spread</strong><a class=wp-block-button__link href=# rel=noopener>Instacart</a><p>This is one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. It’s incredible. La Terra Fina’s version of this iconic dip was the best French onion dip we tried when we returned to the tasting table for a second taste test. Heavenly is the best word to describe it. The base is lusciously creamy. The onion flavor is strong. You get actual pieces of onion in this dip. The roasted garlic adds to the subtle sweetness without being distracting. This is a dip I would pay money for at a restaurant. Luckily, I don’t have to! I can eat it for less money from the comfort of my couch.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Liv Averett / Instacart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other French onion dips we tried:</strong> Hidden Valley Ranch, Helluva Good, Kite Hill, Violife, Trader Joe’s, Trader Joe’s (Vegan), Bitchin’ Sauce Caramelized Onion</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFustGepZygXaS7qrvNZpuiqF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
