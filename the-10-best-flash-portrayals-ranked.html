The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2023 DC blockbuster</a> stars <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ezra Miller</a>, who has played the character since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman vs Superman</a>, and it was confirmed by James Gunn that this film would serve as a catalyst for the upcoming reboot. As of writing, the film has received an average critics score of 66 percent and an audience score of 85 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>But did you know that many others have portrayed the Scarlet Speedster? From various films, TV shows, and even terrible pilots and straight-to-DVD releases, The Flash’s story and powers have been adapted in many ways. It’s ultimately up to fans to determine for themselves which one they consider to be their “definition of The Flash,” but here is our take on the top 10 portrayals of the scarlet speedster throughout time.</p><h2 id=h-10-adam-devine-the-lego-batman-movie data-injectable=false>10. Adam DeVine – The LEGO Batman Movie</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The LEGO Batman Movie</a> mostly explored Batman and his relationship with Dick Grayson, we got a glimpse of the Flash in his LEGO form. He may not have been like all the other portrayals of the scarlet speedster, but he was there to show that a LEGO Justice League exists. Unlike other portrayals of this superhero, this one is more catered to younger audiences.</p><h2 id=h-9-kenny-johnston-justice-league-of-america data-injectable=false>9. Kenny Johnston – Justice League of America</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=528 data-current-count=828 data-injectable=true>Back in 2020, Kenny Johnston hosted an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AMA event on Reddit,</a> and he introduced himself by saying, “I played The Flash in the CBS Pilot Justice League of America. One of the worst Pilots ever.” Looking at the clips that made their way onto YouTube, he may have had a point. His portrayal of the Scarlet Speedster felt campy and didn’t pay tribute to the hero we know and love. What’s interesting is that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this is the exact same sentiment that the actor had</a>. At least he had fun on set during its production.</p><h2 id=h-8-neil-patrick-harris-justice-league-the-new-frontier data-injectable=false>8. Neil Patrick Harris – Justice League – The New Frontier</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=794 data-injectable=true>Did you know Neil Patrick Harris played The Flash in 2008? Unlike the other animated adaptation of the scarlet speedster, this one seems to be more adult and uses his powers wisely. He really is the superhero that we know in the comics. Such a shame we never got to see more of this actor’s voice work. What’s also more surprising is how not many people knew about NPH’s take unless they’ve watched every DC animated title in existence or scrolled through his IMDB page.</p><h2 id=h-7-keiynan-lonsdale-cw-s-the-flash data-injectable=false>7. Keiynan Lonsdale – CW’s The Flash</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>The Arrowverse introduced us to different versions of The Flash, but there is one that’s hardly ever talked about. Keiynan Lonsdale played Wally West, the brother of Iris West. He is also known as Kid Flash, a speedster who’s different from Grant Gustin’s Flash. This speedster not only had similar abilities to our main hero, but he also could use lightning in different ways thanks to his time in the Peace Corps and immersing himself in Buddhist culture.</p><h2 id=h-6-ezra-miller-2023-the-flash data-injectable=false>6. Ezra Miller – 2023 The Flash</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=491 data-current-count=791 data-injectable=true>While Ezra Miller himself is pretty questionable, he did play The Flash with justice, even if it meant he ended up becoming “the Janitor of the Justice League.” Such a shame that this Flash portrayal had such a short time on screen. It would have been interesting to see this version of the Scarlet Speedster have a future in the DCU, or at least in DC Elseworlds, especially when The Flash filmmaker, Andy Muschietti, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wanted Miller to come back once more for a potential sequel.</a></p><h2 id=h-5-justin-chambers-justice-league-the-flashpoint-paradox data-injectable=false>5. Justin Chambers – Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=865 data-injectable=true>Like 2023’s The Flash, The Justice League – The Flashpoint Paradox took inspiration from the Flashpoint story and made its own, with some stories removed due to runtime. In this film, Justin Chambers played the Scarlet Speedster, who realizes that his universe changed due to Zoom’s actions. This version of the Flash seemed to be more mature and adult, which makes sense since he’s one of the few people who remember the original timeline. It was up to him to save the universe, and Chambers’ portrayal of this superhero was on point.</p><h2 id=h-4-michael-rosenbaum-justice-league-unlimited data-injectable=false>4. Michael Rosenbaum – Justice League Unlimited</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>For those born around the ’90s, Michael Rosenbaum’s portrayal of the Scarlet Speedster would be most kids’ first impressions of the DC superhero. He’s witty and somewhat comedic, and despite him looking like an adult, he does have a heart of a child. Regardless, this Justice League hero was someone the kids could resonate with, someone who wanted to save the world all the while being energetic, just like the show’s target audience.</p><h2 id=h-3-john-wesley-shipp-the-flash-1990 data-injectable=false>3. John Wesley Shipp – The Flash (1990)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>You might know John Wesley Shipp as Jay Garrick in CW’s The Flash. But did you know that the actor played the hero back in the 1990s? The ’90s Flash series aired on CBS and had a total of 22 episodes. Shipp played the Scarlet Speedster in his version of Central City. The role was later reprised in the Arrowverse during the “Crisis of Infinite Earths” TV event, where he reprised his ’90s character once more, stating that his universe is called “Earth-90.”</p><h2 id=h-2-kyle-gallner-smallville data-injectable=false>2. Kyle Gallner – Smallville</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=661 data-current-count=961 data-injectable=true>This version of The Flash was first introduced in season four of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Smallville</a>. Unlike the other Flash variants, this one wasn’t some intern or detective from Central City Police but rather a teenager who acted of his own accord. This portrayal of Flash is interesting since he’s someone whom most teenagers could vibe with. Before the two parted ways, he was the one who pitched to Clark to form a “league” that the two and other similar meta-humans could join, hinting at a future for the Justice League in this universe. He may not have the same origin story, but he still gave hope to Clark that he’s not the only one with powers.</p><h2 id=h-1-grant-gustin-cw-s-the-flash data-injectable=false>1. Grant Gustin – CW’s The Flash</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Gustin</a> played the role of Barry Allen for nearly a decade. Eventually, he became loved by fans and became the Flash of the late 2010s. This scarlet speedster has done it all: Flashpoint events, alternate universes, time travel, and teaming up with a temporary Justice League. While it was sad to see him go by the end of season 9, fans wished that he had had a small cameo in the 2023 DC film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWZ9bq7ErKtmnpyWwKl5z6ipraqRrq6tv4yrmKejlZl8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
