Don’t be the party animals of “<a href=#>The Hangover</a>” every weekend or risk great bodily harm. The grass on the other side of the fence isn’t just a duller shade of green than we first expect but it’s laced with poison. There's no poison here. Despite a premise rife with potential dark humor, there’s too little edge in “Let’s Be Cops.” Director/co-writer <a href=#>Luke Greenfield</a> chose wacky over witty and the result is a film with no sense of danger, no reason to care and not enough laughs to make the sitcomish handling of a strong premise forgivable.</p><p>Ryan (Johnson) is a mostly out-of-work actor whose most infamous credit is a commercial for STD medication. He’s not in a very good place. Neither is Justin (Wayans), a video game developer who doesn’t quite have the spine to stand up to his annoying boss (Jon Lajoie), who takes his hard work on a game about a police officer and turns it into Firefighters vs. Zombies. To research that game, Justin came into possession of a pair of legitimate police officer uniforms, and Ryan convinces his more uptight buddy that they should use them to attend a costume party reunion (that turns out to be more of a masquerade ball, further embarrassing our heroes). Dejected after the reunion reminds them of their recent failures, Ryan and Justin are walking the streets of L.A. when they realize that the uniform commands a certain kind of respect and admiration from the ladies. Why not be cops a little longer?</p><p>Well, because it’s highly illegal and incredibly dangerous, of course. Justin realizes this and tries to put a stop to it but Ryan becomes relatively unhinged, buying a cop car on eBay and pulling people over. And the pair even gets involved in a real case involving the gorgeous daughter of a restaurant owner (<a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a>), who becomes a love interest for Justin, and a maniacal gang leader played with physical fury by James D’ Arcy. <a href=#>Rob Riggle</a> pops up as a real cop who crosses paths with the two while <a href=#>Keegan Michael Key</a> steals a few scenes as an over-the-top dealer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lnK2rXZeybq%2FOqapmamBmgQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
