She was also an outstanding folklorist and anthropologist who recorded cultural history, as illustrated by her Mules and Men. Hurston died in poverty in 1960, before a revival of interest led to posthumous recognition of her accomplishments.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston was born on January 7, 1891, in Notasulga, Alabama. Her birthplace has been the subject of some debate since Hurston herself wrote in her autobiography that she was born in Eatonville, Florida. However, according to many other sources, she took some creative license with that fact. She probably had no memories of Notasulga, having moved to Florida as a toddler. Hurston was also known to adjust her birth year from time to time as well. Her birthday, according to Zora Neale Hurston: A Life in Letters (1996), may not be January 7, but January 15.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston was the daughter of two formerly enslaved people. Her father, John Hurston, was a pastor, and he moved the family to Florida when Hurston was very young. Following the death of her mother, Lucy Ann (Potts) Hurston, in 1904, and her father's subsequent remarriage, Hurston lived with an assortment of family members for the next few years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To support herself and finance her efforts to get an education, Hurston worked a variety of jobs, including as a maid for an actress in a touring Gilbert and Sullivan group. In 1920, Hurston earned an associate degree from Howard University, having published one of her earliest works in the university's newspaper.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Harlem Renaissance</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston moved to New York City's Harlem neighborhood in the 1920s. She became a fixture in the area's thriving art scene, with her apartment reportedly becoming a popular spot for social gatherings. Hurston befriended the likes of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/langston-hughes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Langston Hughes" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Langston Hughes</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/countee-cullen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Countee Cullen" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Countee Cullen</a>, among several others, with whom she launched a short-lived literary magazine, Fire!!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Along with her literary interests, Hurston landed a scholarship to Barnard College, where she pursued the subject of anthropology and studied with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/franz-boas data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franz Boas" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franz Boas</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Sweat,' and 'How It Feels to be Colored Me'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston established herself as a literary force with her spot-on accounts of the African American experience. One of her early acclaimed short stories, "Sweat" (1926), told of a woman dealing with an unfaithful husband who takes her money, before receiving his comeuppance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston also drew attention for her autobiographical essay "How It Feels to be Colored Me" (1928), in which she recounted her childhood and the jolt of moving to an all-white area. Additionally, Hurston contributed articles to magazines, including the Journal of American Folklore.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Jonah's Gourd Vine' and Other Books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston published her first novel, Jonah's Gourd Vine, in 1934. Like her other famed works, this one told the tale of the African American experience, only through a man, flawed pastor John Buddy Pearson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Having returned to Florida to collect African American folk tales in the late 1920s, Hurston went on to publish a collection of these stories, titled Mules and Men (1935).</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">'Their Eyes Were Watching God'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Upon receiving a Guggenheim fellowship, Hurston traveled to Haiti and wrote what would become her most famous work: Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937). The novel tells the story of Janie Mae Crawford, who learns the value of self-reliance through multiple marriages and tragedy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although highly acclaimed today, the book drew its share of criticism at the time, particularly from leading men in African American literary circles. Author <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/richard-wright data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Wright" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Richard Wright</a>, for one, decried Hurston's style as a "minstrel technique" designed to appeal to white audiences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1942, she published her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, a personal work that was well-received by critics.</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Plays</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1930s, Hurston explored the fine arts through a number of different projects. She worked with Hughes on a play called Mule-Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life—disputes over the work would eventually lead to a falling out between the two—and wrote several other plays, including The Great Day and From Sun to Sun.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Controversies</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston was charged with molesting a 10-year-old boy in 1948; despite strong evidence that the accusation was false, her reputation suffered greatly in the aftermath.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Additionally, Hurston experienced some backlash for her criticism of the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/brown-v-board-of-education-of-topeka data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brown v. Board of Education" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Brown v. Board of Education</a>, which called for the end of school segregation.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For all her accomplishments, Hurston struggled financially and personally during her final decade. She kept writing, but she had difficulty getting her work published.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few years later, Hurston had suffered several strokes and was living in the St. Lucie County Welfare Home. The once-famous writer and folklorist died poor and alone on January 28, 1960, and was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More than a decade after her death, another great talent helped to revive interest in Hurston and her work: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/alice-walker data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alice Walker" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alice Walker</a> wrote about Hurston in the essay "In Search of Zora Neale Hurston," published in Ms. magazine in 1975. Walker's essay helped introduce Hurston to a new generation of readers and encouraged publishers to print new editions of Hurston's long-out-of-print novels and other writings. In addition to Walker, Hurston heavily influenced Gayl Jones and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ralph-ellison data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Ellison" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Ellison</a>, among other writers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Robert Hemenway's acclaimed biography, Zora Neale Hurston (1977), continued the renewal of interest in the forgotten literary great. Today, her legacy endures through such efforts as the annual Zora! Festival in her old hometown of Eatonville.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hurston's posthumous book, Barracoon: The Story of the Last “Black Cargo," was published in 2018. The book is based on her interviews from the 1920s with Oluale Kossola, who's enslaved name was Cudjo Lewis, the last living survivor of the Middle Passage. Prior to being published, the manuscript was in the Howard University library archives.</p><ul data-node-id=35 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Zora Neale Hurston</li><li>Birth Year: 1891</li><li>Birth date: January 7, 1891</li><li>Birth State: Alabama</li><li>Birth City: Notasulga</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Writer and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston was a fixture of the Harlem Renaissance and author of the masterwork 'Their Eyes Were Watching God.'</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Fiction and Poetry</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Capricorn</li><li>Death Year: 1960</li><li>Death date: January 28, 1960</li><li>Death State: Florida</li><li>Death City: Fort Pierce</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=40 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Zora Neale Hurston Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/zora-neale-hurston</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 23, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=43 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>There are years that ask questions and years that answer.</li><li>Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place.</li><li>I do not weep at the world I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGiYrqyYpL%2B0edaroK2doqh8u7vRmmSnnZGhsm601Kuqraee</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
