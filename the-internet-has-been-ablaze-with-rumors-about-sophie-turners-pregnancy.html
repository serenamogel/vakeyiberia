On Monday, the 25-year-old actress fueled curiosity by wearing a white crop top highlighting her belly. The actress softly put her palm on her tummy and piqued netizens’ interest, who suspected she was expecting her second kid. The internet has been ablaze with speculation that Sophie Turner is pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophie Turner is married to Joe Jonas of the renowned Jonas Brothers. Willa, their 19-month-old daughter, is the couple’s first child.</p><h2>The internet responds to reports of Sophie Turner’s purported pregnancy.</h2><p>Netizens were taken aback when they discovered the Time Freak actress was pregnant since she was due to give birth to her kid in 2020.&nbsp;Some fans thought it was strange that the pregnancy rumors surfaced so soon after her sister-in-law Priyanka Chopra’s recent announcement. The Quantico star confirmed that she and her husband, Nick Jonas, had become parents.&nbsp;Turner chose to keep her first pregnancy discreet by avoiding the cameras. According to HITC, she admitted in a recent Instagram Q&A session that she missed being pregnant and having her pregnant tummy. She also posted a photo of herself with a baby belly.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Sophie-Turner-2.jpg alt="Sophie Turner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Turner went on to say:</p><p>“If I can put on a mask while giving birth, you can put on a mask at Walmart.” That’s all there is to it.”</p><h2>Joe Jonas and Sophie’s Relationship</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Sophie-Turner-3.jpg alt="Sophie Turner" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The pair became romantically involved in 2016 and married in October of the following year. They married in an intimate and private ceremony at Las Vegas ‘A Little White Wedding Chapel.’ Because the couple was attending the Billboard Music Awards the day before their wedding, they had numerous celebrities attend the private event. An Elvis impersonator conducted the wedding, and the couple had a wonderful day. DJ Diplo also broadcasted the event live on Instagram. Jonas and Turner also had a wedding in France for their extended relatives and friends. The event took place on June 29, 2019.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiroZ1dnru1sdGnnK1lmJbAbq7EnqVmmZKhrruxjLCgraBdp8Kuu9GsZJqan6rBbr%2FOqZ%2BinV2pwrO6xKuqZqiimrSvrc2csGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
