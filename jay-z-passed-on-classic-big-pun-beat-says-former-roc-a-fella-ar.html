Podcast. “‘Still Not A Player, I had that. I had ‘Woah,’ I think <a class=underline-link href=#>[Memphis] Bleek</a> passed on that. We had ‘Lights, Camera, Action,’ [JAY] said it was too slow. I was like, ‘What you mean it’s too slow?'”</p><p>Released in 1998, “Still Not A Player” featuring Joe was technically a remix of Big Pun’s 1997 single “I’m Not A Player,” but ended up surpassing the success of the original in many ways and became Pun’s highest ranked song on the&nbsp;Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p><p></p><p>In 2014, <a class=underline-link href=#>Joe revealed that he never expected the collaboration to be as successful as it wa</a>s.</p><p>“The ‘Still Not A Player’ record was kinda funny because I had ‘Don’t Wanna Be A Player’ as my single at the time. And Pun had, I think, a similar record too,” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>VLAD TV</a>. “The two songs were so similar we just sat down and chopped it up and was like ‘Yo, we should just merge the two.’”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “And [I] played a few tracks and it came around to this one particular track. It just felt like the right one. And <a href=#>Fat Joe</a> got with us. We got in the studio and I put the hook down. Pun apparently had his verse written out to a T. I didn’t think the record was gonna take off like that to be honest with you. It was one of those records where I loved it. I thought it was fun, but I didn’t know it was gonna be like a mega-mega-hit.”</p><p>Years prior to passing on the “Still Not A Player” beat, JAY-Z had connected with Knobody to create what became his first charting single, “Can’t Knock The Hustle,” which remains a fan favorite.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>While Hov passed on a handful of songs that he predicted would be hits, Hip Hop said he always took it in stride when other artists ended up proving his ear had been correct.</p><p>“I’m never really [holding] grudges or like, ‘I told you so.’ I’m already moving on to the next record,” the veteran music exec said. “‘Cause sometimes it’s just like only 14 songs. So it’s like, whatever’s best for the record. So I know that a record gotta motivate him. That’s why, any hook I ever did, I had to convince him to do the record.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/08/pun-250x142.jpg alt="Meek Mill Previews Three New Tracks, Including One That Flips Classic Big Pun Sample" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Meek Mill Previews Three New Tracks, Including One That Flips Classic Big Pun Sample</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>August 3, 2022</p></a><p>That approach led to the creation of “Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)” and the <a href=#>UGK</a>-assisted “Big Pimpin’.” With the latter, <a class=underline-link href=#>Hip Hop also had to do some coaxing to get Pimp C on board</a>, he revealed during the interview.</p><p>Like&nbsp;<a href=#>Bun B</a> has previously said, =Hop shared that Pimp C’s love and respect for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>2Pac</a>&nbsp;— whose death was still recent when talk of recording the JAY-Z single first came up — was&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=#>the first obstacle that had to be overcome</a> to get the late Texas legend on the track.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“But once he got past that, he thought Jay was saying that he was playing with his dick in the truck,” Joshua recounted. “So he’s like, ‘Man, I’m not getting on no song with another man talkin’ bout playing with hisself in the truck! Young Hop, you my boy, but what you tryna have me doin’, man?’ He said, ‘That’s like career suicide!’”</p><p>Hip-Hop clarified that the line in question, which hears JAY-Z rap: “Let ’em play with the dick in the truck,”&nbsp;actually referred to would-be female passengers. “He said, ‘I could see that. That makes sense now.’ Then he kinda got closer to doing it,” Hop added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mihmrFdr3qxrdKsnJ1ln6N6pLjArKqim12Xtqh5z66lZpqVlsFuv8Cyqmaen6e6pr6Mq6acZZFis6a4y5pkmqo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
