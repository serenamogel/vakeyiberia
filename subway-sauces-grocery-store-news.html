It’s the sauce, baybee (and also the banana peppers)! So get excited because over the next few weeks, Subway is dropping not one, not two, but four of their signature Subway sauces in grocery stores all around the country as a partnership with Marzetti, the famous <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-salad-dressing/>salad dressing</a>, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-dips/>dip</a>, sauce, and <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-croutons/>crouton</a> company. All this just in time for National Sauce Month, which, as it turns out, is March. Looks like Women’s History Month has some competish.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Which Subway sauces will they be dropping? Why do we need a National Sauce Month? And, most importantly, will these sauces make my kitchen smell exactly like Subway (to be clear I want this)?</h2><p>The initial four-sauce drop this month will include Sweet Onion Teriyaki, Baja Chipotle, Roasted Garlic Aioli, and one that is not in Subway stores (at least currently), Creamy Italian MVP, which seems to be a riff on Subway’s existing MVP Parmesan Vinaigrette. As for what MVP stands for here, it turns out it’s not anything food related. Instead, it’s a reference to Subway’s MVP rewards program, so it’s probably “most valued player” and not “mayo-vinegar-parmesan,” as I had initially suspected. These sauces can be used as sandwich condiments, dips, marinades—the sky is the limit here. Subway wants us to get creative with it. As for whether I can use these to get my kitchen to smell like a Subway, I think if I open a jar of <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-dill-pickles/>pickles</a>, bake some bread, and throw a <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://sporked.com/article/best-chocolate-chip-cookies/>cookie</a> in the toaster with some ham and cheese on it at the same time as using these sauces, I have a fair shot at making my olfactory dreams a reality. As for whether we need a national sauce month…I mean, come on, what can sauce do that women can’t? As much as I love sauce, I move that we instead give it a week in the fall instead. Maybe the week before Thanksgiving. Thoughts?</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I do think sauce is important. In fact, these new Subway sauces aren’t just going to be a pretty face at the grocery store, they will also help Subway employees fund their college educations. Part of the proceeds from the sauces will go toward supporting the Fresh Start Scholarship Fund, a program that offers the recipient Sandwich Artists (the extremely rad actual name for Subway employees) $2,500 to use toward their secondary education.</p><p>As for where you can get these four saucemen of the subpocalypse, looks like they will be available at select retailers in the coming weeks, including Walmart, Kroger, and Albertsons. So get some when you see them and make all your home eating “fresh” from now on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaKull8SixYysmK6blah6qL7OnJyrsV2owbC%2BxGalnq%2BjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
