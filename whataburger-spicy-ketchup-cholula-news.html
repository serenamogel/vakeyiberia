I am not one such person. I can, however, appreciate a fast-food joint with a cult following and some special sauces (oh, In-N-Out, my beloved), especially when said fast-food joint lets us buy those sauces at our very own local grocery stores. That’s right, Whataburger’s special “Spicy Ketchup Limited Batch 2” (not to be confused with the original Whataburger Spicy Ketchup) will now be available in grocery stores. Not only that, but Whataburger has revealed the secret ingredient in their Whataburger Spicy Ketchup Limited Batch 2. The secret in question? Cholula.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Where can we find this new Whataburger spicy ketchup? Did Whataburger just singlehandedly solve all my problems? Is Cholulu, in fact, the solulu?</h2><p>All good questions to be sure, and yes, Cholulu is always the solulu. It seems like Whataburger’s spicy ketchup already had somewhat of a following, so this move to retail was a natural next step. <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.mysanantonio.com/food/article/whataburger-spicy-ketchup-18649118.php rel=noopener>According to Mysanantonio.com</a>, the vice president of marketing at McCormick (which owns Cholula) said that, “With Whataburger’s strong followership in the Spicy Ketchup game, we’re thrilled to reintroduce Spicy Ketchup #2 and reveal that it does, in fact, combine the distinctive flavored heat of Cholula.” This truly is Cholula spicy ketchup. I’m sure it’s good on burgers, but can y’all imagine this condiment on EGGS? Ugh, the best.</p><p>As for where you can get your hands on some of this spicy, ketchupy goodness, it is available now at H-E-B locations across Texas. If you aren’t in Texas, you might be thinking “Whatabout me?” But don’t fret—Whataburger Spicy Ketchup Limited Batch 2 can also be purchased online at the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Whatastore</a> for only 3 bucks a bottle. And what a store it is. They’ve got ranch, BBQ sauce, mustard, ketchup, pancake mix—end of list. Just kidding they also have a lot of merch (including a Whataburger-branded knockoff Stanley cup that is sold out, naturally). But food-wise it’s just the condiments (with some added Whataburger flair) and the pancakes. Can someone from Texas please tell me what’s going on here? Are these the main things sold at Whataburger? Is it called Whataburger because they actually sell pancakes and are genuinely asking us, the consumer, “What a burger?” because they simply don’t know? I guess what I’m trying to say is, “Whatawhataburger?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsGirtSrnp6qXai9qq%2FYZqKerJOdwrF5wqGmpa2clnqvsdasZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
