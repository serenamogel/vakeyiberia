As a result, fans are threatening to boycott the project.</p><p>So, what did Drake say about Megan?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Drake, Megan Thee Stallion</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Drake say about Megan Thee Stallion on his new album with 21 Savage? The rappers’ beef explained.</h2><p>Drake and 21’s “Circo Loco” samples <a href=#>Daft Punk’s</a> “One More Time." The upbeat, house-reminiscent single is a nod to the widely popular dance parties thrown at the DC10 nightclub in Ibiza, Spain.</p><p>The song features a lyric that references the long-lived feud between <a href=#>Tory Lanez</a> and Megan Thee Stallion, and now the internet is up in arms. In “Circo Loco,” Drake raps, “This b---h lie 'bout getting shots, but she still a stallion.”</p><p>His lyrics reference the August 2020 incident between Tory and Meg where she accused the former of shooting her in the foot amid an altercation. Although the case isn’t closed yet, tons of speculations about the incident have surfaced online — and it’s clear that the industry has taken sides.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Megan thee Stallion responded to Drake’s "Circo Loco" diss.

Following the song’s release, Meg took to social media to share her thoughts on the track.</p><p>“I know I’m very popular but y’all gotta stop attaching weak-ass conspiracy theories in bars to my name.” Meg <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, “[N-words] nor h-es ever address me or @ me with a fact or receipts.”</p><p>She went on to call Drake “lame” and accused him of using her name to gain popularity. The “Sweetest Pie” rapper <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, “Stop using my shooting for clout b---h a-- [n-words]! Since when the f--k is it cool to joke about women getting shot?”</p><p>Meg wasn’t the only one who found Drake’s comments distasteful. Listeners on social media also shared their two cents about the rapper’s lyrics.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The number of people going out of their way to defend Drake for that shitty lyric about Meg is disappointing.
