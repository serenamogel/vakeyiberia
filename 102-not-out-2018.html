How are we supposed to take this guy or his life lessons seriously&nbsp;when he looks like&nbsp;that?&nbsp;</p><p>There's no simple answer to that admittedly loaded question, mostly because Bachchan's character is hard to take seriously&nbsp;until just before&nbsp;the film's halfway mark. The turning point is a scene where Babulal takes one of his dad's challenges and has a credible&nbsp;breakthrough. At this point, Bachchan's character lets Kapoor take over, and&nbsp;"102 Not Out" becomes a relatively sober melodrama about how awful it is to be old and taken for granted.&nbsp;</p><p>Babulal's estranged son Amol (Dharmendra Gohil) figures prominently in this hour-long stretch&nbsp;since he is conveniently—but sympathetically—blamed for neglecting his father, and therefore making Babulal feel unworthy of a good life. This is a very Bollywood mentality: Dattatraya, representing&nbsp;the older generation, knows best because he knows Babulal better than he knows himself, and therefore tries to teach his son how to not see himself as&nbsp;a mere reflection of his own&nbsp;ungrateful son's desires. There's even a psychodrama-style scene (complete with thunder, dim lighting, and declamatory recriminations) where Dattatraya lays out all the ways that Amol has neglected his father and his late mother. It's a bombastic sequence, but it works because Bachchan and Kapoor both deliver winningly hammy performances.</p><p>And at some point in this "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"-like scene, you realize that Bachchan's wig has become matted down. Patches of his scalp peek out from&nbsp;under&nbsp;his wig's&nbsp;wispy&nbsp;strands, and his&nbsp;chic circular glasses come off more often.&nbsp;And at this point, Bachchan stops looking like an aging star in a Halloween costume and starts looking like a vulnerable older guy who, in the right light, can still seem handsome. "102 Not Out" won't win Bachchan any awards, but it proves that this aging figurehead&nbsp;still wears his&nbsp;natural charms lightly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v45qZ2tlnqTBbrvUrWRraGFt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
