"Hi everyone. Look, I'm so sorry for everyone who might have been tuning in to watch the Golden Globes. Chris&nbsp;and I aren't going to be there," he said of himself and&nbsp;<a href=#>his wife Christine Baumgarter</a>.&nbsp;Costner further explained that this was the second time in the last five years that the freeway near his home flooded out, which left his family unable to get home the night before. Despite his disappointment at missing the Globes,&nbsp;he explained Baumgarter "went out and bought me some gold and yellow and black and silver balloons" to celebrate the night at home. "So we're gonna [watch] the television and see what happens," he said.</p><p>Although Costner could not be there, his "Yellowstone" co-stars Cole Hauser and Mo Brings Plenty represented the series at the award show, per <a href=#>Wide Open Country</a>. At the end of his video, Costner stated, "I hope we're invited back."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlmaIBzgI6tn55lo5ius8WMq5yaq5%2Bjeqyx1aKlZpufqMGvsdFmn5qcXam8br%2FKoqdmrJiaenN8kWxkoKecmbKvecalppudo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
