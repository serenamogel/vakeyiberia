Internet users who’ve been traversing the web for more than a decade or so will remember the entertainment website well. It’s still around today, but doesn’t boast nearly the popularity it claimed in its heyday.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>One of the former contributors to this artsy flash-animation website is JonTron, an American comedian and content creator who has since turned to <strong>YouTube</strong>. On the immensely popular video-sharing website, Jontron⏤whose real name is Jonathan Aryan Jafari⏤has collected more than 6.65 million subscribers for his channel, titled the “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JonTronShow</a>.” The channel has rocketed in popularity in recent years, as have several of his related channels, including “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JonTronLoL</a>,” which has a whopping 20.7 million subscribers.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>JonTron’s videos, which typically see the creator digging into internet drama, sharing his comedic take on current events, or playing a variety of games, typically get view counts between 2 million and 15 million. In total, his videos⏤some of which have been around since his channel launched in 2010⏤have more than 1 billion views. Even his oldest uploads, most of which see him trying his hand at streaming games, have view counts in the low millions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/maxresdefault-28.jpg><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Over the years, JonTron has taken part in a number of lucrative career ventures. He has collaborated with some of YouTube’s biggest channels, including h3h3 productions and Did You Know Gaming. He started a Let’s Play series titled “Game Grumps” with animator Egoraptor, whose real name is Arin Joseph Hanson, and has provided voice-over work for several games, including “A Hat in Time” and “Yooka-Laylee.”</p><p data-characters=663 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>The 31-year-old YouTuber has transformed his talent for content creation into monetary returns. Thanks to the ad revenue his YouTube uploads earn, JonTron boasts a relatively high monthly income. According to estimations from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">What’s Their Net Worth</a>, JonTron makes approximately $12,500 monthly from his YouTube earnings alone. Weekly, he makes nearly $3,000, which translates to around $150,000 annually. His income has generally trended upward over the last five years or so. Back in 2016, JonTron earned an estimated $153,500. Since then, he has built on those annual returns to make more than double that amount in 2020, when he earned right around $258,000.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>His consistent <strong>YouTube</strong> income has earned JonTron a net worth of around $2.2 million. His overall net worth may in fact be a bit higher than this, thanks to the multiple other avenues⏤including with collaborations and via Twitch⏤through which he earns money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNit7C606ump2Wdlrimew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
