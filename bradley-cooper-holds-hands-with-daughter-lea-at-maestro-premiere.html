She was dressed up in an animal print gown, sparkling gold flats and a red purse while Cooper wore a dark blue suit.</p><p>Maestro, which will be available to stream on Netflix later this month, was directed and cowritten by Cooper. In the film, Cooper <a href=#>plays the late composer Leonard Bernstein</a> alongside a star-studded cast, including <strong>Carey Mulligan, Matt Bomer, Maya Hawke, Sarah Silverman </strong>and<strong> Michael Urie</strong>.</p><p>When Cooper isn’t working, he is focused on coparenting his daughter with <strong>Irina Shayk</strong>. The former couple welcomed Lea in 2017, two years after they began dating. Cooper and Shayk, 37, <a href=#>subsequently called it quits</a> in June 2019 but have remained on friendly terms.</p><p>Shayk previously opened up about how she and Cooper <a href=#>tackle raising their daughter</a> together, telling Elle in March 2021, “When I’m with my daughter, I’m 100 percent a mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100 percent her dad. Coparenting is parenting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bradley-Cooper-Celebrates-Maestro-Premiere-With-Daughter-Lea-by-His-Side-2.jpg><p>The model went on to explain why she chose to remain tight-lipped about her bond with Cooper. “My past relationship, it’s something that belongs to me, and it’s private. It’s just a piece of my inner self that I don’t want to give away,” she added.</p><p>Later that year, Shayk praised Cooper for <a href=#>being a “full-on, hands-on dad,”</a> telling Highsnobiety in September 2021, “No nanny. Lea went on holiday with him for almost two weeks — I didn’t call them once.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bradley-Cooper-Celebrates-Maestro-Premiere-With-Daughter-Lea-by-His-Side-1.jpg><p>The twosome have enforced some “strict” rules for their daughter. “When [Lea] finishes eating, she gets up from the table, takes her plate, says, ‘Thank you.’ Without ‘please’ or ‘thank you,’ she’s not getting anything,” Shayk, who was<a href=#> linked to <strong>Tom Brady</strong> </a>this year, explained. “It’s hard, because she has so many toys. I had one doll, and I still have this doll. Blonde, blue eyes, big Russian doll. My grandma used to make clothes for her. And I always explain, ‘Look, this is my doll. I had only one.’ Or sometimes, ‘You have this candy. I used to have candy only for Christmas.'”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cooper, for his part, shared rare insight into <a href=#>his parenting philosophy</a> during a July episode of Running Wild With Bear Grylls: The Challenge.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bradley-Cooper-Celebrates-Maestro-Premiere-With-Daughter-Lea-by-His-Side-3.jpg><p>“I mean, you learn from your predecessor’s mistakes and I’ll make tons that hopefully Lea will learn from and then being rigorous with myself to grow,” he said. “To help unburden her with any of my bulls—t.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGabqpGZuabFjJymqKiVp3qpu8udqmagkaOxtHnWoquhZZSWwqi0056pZqSVlnqiwIymmJ6rpKe8brzRnqSinaKafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
