Just know I had a Big Brother …. JoJo had an uncle …. And His name Was Kevin Lemons !</p><p>Gave this little girl who had just arrived to ATL a chance . I attended a stellar awards in Vegas for the first time with him and the choir . He always kept in touch . He pushed me and believed in me . He thought I was a way better singer than I thought I was . I can’t believe this . My prayers are with his beautiful wife and and choir . Love people now ❤️</p><p>Official Announcement from The Lemons Family 🕊️</p><p>It is with great sadness that we announce the transition of our Founder – Kevin Lemons. Please keep his wife Tiunna, Family and Higher Calling lifted in prayer as we all process this sudden loss. Thank you all for the outpouring of love already shown. We are so appreciative and grateful for each of you! 🍋🕊️</p><p>Thank You JP Designs Art!! 💛</p><p>I’ve been trying to gather my thoughts and I still don’t have a lot to say. 🥹 Kevin Lemons…wow…he was the first person in the Gospel Music Industry to call me “Auntie”. ☺️ Watching him sing, direct, and train his choir always made me smile because I knew the Gospel Music Industry was in great hands.</p><p>My heart is truly broken-I loved and respected him so much and so did my daughter-she was one of his biggest supporters.</p><p>Tiunna, you, your family and the entire Higher Calling Choir members are in my thoughts and prayers. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 The music industry and the Kingdom has taken another huge hit!! Let’s love on each other while we have the opportunity. I love you all so very much and I’m praying for us all!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️</p><p>Y’all, this isn’t a celebrity thing for me (even though he definitely is one!). This man was a kind soul. Nice. Full of knowledge. Definitely could sing and teach his butt off. He poured into me. He connected me with people to better myself and the ministry. I was a fan long before meeting him in person in 2017. The conversations, good dude, caring person, the way he called me when he got news my friend, sister, and choir member passed, was it for me. Plus the man made it his business to come to an event of mines. NOT TO SING…..to legit support ME! I legit have all of his music, some product as well, but Kevin dope and bigger than the dope choir music he made. His music opened the door for others to get to know him if you got the chance! I will miss HIM. Praying so hard for Lady Lemons, his entire family, friends, and Kevin Lemons and Higher Calling family. RIH Uncle Kevin Lemons. (Thanks for accepting me for me, showing and teaching me, and adopting me as a musical nephew)</p><p>💔💔🍋🍋</p><p>Our heartfelt condolences go out to the deceased’s family and friends, who have been struggling with the loss of such an intelligent and compassionate individual.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
