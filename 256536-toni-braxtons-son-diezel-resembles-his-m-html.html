The young model has grown up looking like his famous mother.</p><p class=Fg>Toni Braxton is one of the highest-selling R&B singers in history. But besides her thriving career, she's also a mom of two - Diezel Ky and Denim Cole Braxton-Lewis.</p><p class=Fg>Recently, Diezel took to Instagram Story to share a picture of himself, proving that he shares remarkable similarities with his 53-year-old mother.</p><p class=Fg>Diezel shared <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/diezel.braxton/>a mirror selfie</a> with a friend. The 17-year-old boy was seated next to a white shelf which displayed a few pairs of shoes and a blue printed shirt.</p><p class=Fg>The young boy braided his hair in pigtails and wore a long-sleeved white shirt. Diezel showed no expression while looking away at the camera. His friend covered his face with his phone.</p><p class=Fg>Even if he showed a deadpan look, Diezel still showed a strong resemblance with Braxton. The post doesn't have a lengthy message, only "4L," a heart, and a black fist emoji.</p><p class=Fg>Diezel earlier made headlines after Braxton revealed he was <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thethings.com/denim-cole-braxton-lewis-toni-braxton-two-sons/>diagnosed with autism</a> as a child. The doting mother thought her son's condition was a punishment from God.</p><p class=Fg>Braxton educated herself about autism and used her platform to bring awareness. She became involved with Autism Speaks, an organization focusing on research about the condition.</p><p class=Fg>Braxton also documented Diezel's development. In 2016, the "Un-Break My Heart" hitmaker shared that her son showed <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/celebrity/celebrity-moms/toni-braxton-son-diezel-autism-symptoms/>no signs of autism</a>.

She said she was lucky that her son is now out of the autism spectrum.</p><p class=Fg>Apart from sharing her good news, Braxton also credited her son's ability to overcome his diagnosis. She lovingly described Diezel as a "social butterfly."</p><p class=Fg>Since his recovery, Diezel has followed in his mother's footsteps in the spotlight.
