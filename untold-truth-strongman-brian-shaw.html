It was a very common event towards the start of my career, so I got to see it a lot." Shaw, who was in Group 4 for the Finals Qualifiers, ended up netting only 2 points in the event, almost at the bottom of the rankings.</p><p>He shared that he was also looking forward to Fingal's Fingers, saying that he'd competed in that event in his first WSM Final. "So, I guess in a lot of ways, you can kind of say it comes full circle maybe â€” my first final and potentially my last final, with having Fingal's Fingers as an event there." That event netted him four points. After the competition, he said (via <a href=#>Men's Health</a>), "I feel the love, I'll say that. ... I'm a lucky man. I'm a very, very lucky man, I'm grateful for all of it, I'm grateful for each and every one of you that's been a part of it in some way, shape, or form."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2lrbGtnZMKvwM6lm2asoqrBqXnSramoppeirq95waugmqZdqLWiw44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
