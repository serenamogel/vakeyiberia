But how much is Jordan Belfort worth today, and how did he come by his fortune? This article will look at his career, accomplishments, and net worth.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Early Life and Career Beginnings</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jordan Belfort was born on July 9, 1962, to a Jewish household in Queens, New York. He grew raised in a middle-class area, the son of accountants. He studied biology at American University and graduated with honors.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He then enrolled in dental school but dropped out after the dean informed him that dentistry was not a lucrative profession.

He went on to become a stockbroker, and in 1987, he co-founded Stratton Oakmont with his friend Danny Porush.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The firm specializes in penny stocks, which are low-cost, high-risk shares of small businesses. Belfort and his brokers employed aggressive and dishonest tactics to convince investors to acquire these stocks, increasing their prices and reaping massive commissions.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Rise to Fame and Success</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Using a “pump and dump” strategy, Belfort and his firm made millions of dollars in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would artificially inflate the values of the stocks they owned before selling them at a large profit before the prices fell.</p><p style=text-align:justify>They also engaged in illicit operations such as money laundering, tax evasion, and insider trading. Belfort earned the moniker “Wolf of Wall Street” and led a lavish lifestyle. He had a Long Island house, a yacht, a helicopter, and several luxury cars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jordan-Belfort-Net-Worth-1.jpg><p style=text-align:justify>He also spent a fortune on drugs, drink, prostitutes, parties, and travel.
