Long gone are the significant life struggles of choosing between music and football. Whether through Hiram Lodge’s vindictive actions in town or Percival Pickens acting as Riverdale’s new villain, different antagonists have brought out other things in the show’s main characters. For most of the central characters, their actions or reactions tended to be a direct result of what was occurring in town by the season’s Big Bad. But, not everyone has gotten the same chance to shine, and sadly, some long-time characters have been pushed to the sidelines or ignored entirely as the series continued and headed into the seven-year time jump.</p><p>However, being left behind is not the show’s only issue with its central characters. Plenty of them also face repetitive storylines or disappear from the main plot altogether. Occasionally, Riverdale has seemed like multiple shows rather than one cohesive one, given how separated the main characters tended to be at any given moment. With one season left to wrap everything up, it is uncertain how long it will take to reach the final steps of character and story development, given the plot twist taking everyone back to the 1950s.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: Pretty Little Liars: Original Sin: Did The Show Undermine The Big Mystery?</span></p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><h2 id=fangs><span class=item-num>10/10</span> Fangs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Fangs-Toni-and-Anthony.jpg><p>As a member of the Southside Serpents, Fangs was a side character early in his introduction. In season three, he got slightly more involved when he started his romance with Kevin while they were both brainwashed by the Farm. As the show continued, Fangs’ involvement mostly kept him connected to Kevin or the Serpents, with him becoming slightly more involved given his relationship with Toni and their son, Anthony. But Fangs does not have much of a storyline of his own. Instead, he tends to pop up where extras are needed but lacks a sense of urgency in the plot.</p><h2 id=reggie><span class=item-num>9/10</span> Reggie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Reggie.jpg><p>When Reggie started dating Veronica, it boosted his time on the show, whether through working at the speakeasy or getting more involved in Veronica’s wishes to take down Hiram. But, when Veronica and Archie got back together, Reggie faded into the background. As a result, Reggie’s storylines regarding his relationship with his abusive father did not get the screen time to earn the growth the show wants to suggest it is making. Meanwhile, Reggie’s plots nearly come to a dead halt if they are not connected to Veronica.</p><h2 id=kevin><span class=item-num>8/10</span> Kevin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Kevin.jpg><p>Although Kevin was a central character in the first season, his importance to the series slowly declined as the show wore on. Eventually, Kevin was only helpful if he was brainwashed by some form of a cult or another individual, such as the Farm or Percival Pickens. Kevin’s romantic storylines have taken a backseat, as have his dreams for Broadway. At various points throughout multiple seasons, Kevin is barely in episodes with only a few lines or is missing entirely. He barely, if ever, holds a role in the show’s most essential mysteries or dangerous elements.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: Roswell, New Mexico: Main Characters’ Endings, Ranked</span></p><h2 id=tabitha><span class=item-num>7/10</span> Tabitha</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Tabitha.jpg><p>Even though Tabitha was only introduced in season five, she has proven to be very useful. Tabitha’s only plan was to have a role in Pop’s Diner. Still, she soon found herself helping Betty with the Lonely Highway and becoming an essential group member when she discovered her powers as a time-traveling Guardian Angel. Tabitha’s romance with Jughead is not the only thing she has going for her; it never was. Tabitha was never someone trapped in the confines of a romantic relationship and always presented herself as a businesswoman and a good friend to the group.</p><h2 id=toni><span class=item-num>6/10</span> Toni</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Toni.jpg><p>Only after the time jump has Toni been involved in more of the central storylines. When Toni was introduced as a Southside Serpent in season two, things seemed promising for her as the prominent Serpent helping Jughead through Southside High School and his initiation into the Serpents. Her romance with Cheryl also became a fan favorite. But, for a while, Toni was stuck being Cheryl’s girlfriend without a solid storyline of her own. Toni would come in and out of storylines but was primarily featured as Cheryl’s girlfriend. Season five changed that, giving Toni more pull in the Riverdale community with her job at Riverdale High School. Although Toni got together with Fangs, and they raised their son, Anthony, together, Toni has shown herself to be a strong character with her own business and work ethic.</p><h2 id=archie><span class=item-num>5/10</span> Archie</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Archie.jpg><p>Archie may be the main character, but it took a while for Archie to join in on the show’s central mysteries. He tended to be on the outskirts, for the most part, heavily dealing with his constant battle against Hiram Lodge. Archie became a vigilante for Riverdale and tried to single-handedly save the town from its downward spiral. But, between his numerous romantic storylines and how often Archie seemed separated from the central mystery until the final episodes of each season, Archie tended not to be the most crucial character Riverdale features. While Archie wants what is best for his loved ones and the town, Riverdale often spreads Archie too thin while making the mistake of turning him into a nearly undefeatable force.</p><h2 id=jughead><span class=item-num>4/10</span> Jughead</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Jughead.jpg><p>As the show’s narrator, Jughead has a different perspective on the world than his friends. For the most part, Jughead has been directly connected to the central mysteries, whether through investigating with Betty or his ability to create portals to other dimensions, such as Rivervale. Jughead has struggled with both his parents, the Serpents, and even toward himself. Jughead’s dark and light sides have been explored through his various relationships and storylines. His willingness to die if it means defeating Percival Pickens shows his selflessness, especially for a character whose role is often not directly in the line of fire.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: Legacies: Why Hope and Josie Had The Best Relationship in the Show</span></p><h2 id=veronica><span class=item-num>3/10</span> Veronica</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Veronica.jpg><p>In some ways, Veronica struggles with immense storyline problems. Her character is tied far too closely to her male scene partners, whether romantic ties to Archie and Reggie or her familial conflict with Hiram. The time jump even teased Veronica’s significant change as being married. Before graduating from high school, Veronica started multiple businesses, including a speakeasy and rum company. While her battle against Hiram did go on for too long, Veronica was constantly shown to be hard-working in her drive for success.</p><h2 id=cheryl><span class=item-num>2/10</span> Cheryl</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverdale-Cheryl.jpg><p>Cheryl Blossom started Riverdale grieving Jason’s death. A loss she was never quite able to cope with, Cheryl compensated for it in ways that proved just how crazy Riverdale was willing to be, such as when Cheryl kept Jason’s corpse in her home. Cheryl has pulled off some of the show’s most bizarre dialogue and plot lines as if it was just another thing on a to-do list. While Cheryl’s character can occasionally struggle by being so separated from the core four’s storylines, such as making her a homebody in season five, season six fixed the problem, giving her more urgency in the main plot.</p><h2 id=betty><span class=item-num>1/10</span> Betty</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.moviewebimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Riverale-Alice-and-Betty.jpg><p>Always amid the central mysteries, Betty Cooper is Riverdale’s most significant character. Most of her time throughout the season is devoted to solving a puzzle or scheme. She refuses to give up even when striving can become time-consuming or psychologically too much. Betty is given a chance to explore the reasons for her dark side and her fear of that potential in the aftermath of discovering her father was the Black Hood. Knowing her connection to serial killers and how her father groomed Betty to become one also played a role in Betty’s fear of dealing with the Trash Bag Killer. Betty grew out of the friendly girl-next-door trope, showing her three-dimensional personality as smart with complex layers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGipoq6Vp7GiuMRmnK%2Bdoq56rq3JqKlmm5iWv6Kv056pZqqRo7imsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
