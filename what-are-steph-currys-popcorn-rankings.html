Duh. Forget about the titles, records, and countless accolades — how Steph Curry feels about the league’s popped-corn offerings is what’s truly important to fans far and wide. So if you came for basketball, you won’t find it here.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>During Curry’s recent interview on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hot Ones</a>, the athlete explained his power-rankings of stadium popcorn and elaborated on the criteria for his overall reviews. The guy spends a lot of time at these places, it would stand to reason that he’s tried their popcorn.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>Check out the full video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>He’s humble. He’s funny. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can hit a hole-in-one</a> from time to time. Is there anything Steph Curry can’t do? During his 2019 season, Steph decided to put arenas across the country on blast by cataloguing their salty snacks — and used five specific criteria to rank them.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-steph-curry-rank-his-popcorn data-injectable=false>How did Steph Curry rank his popcorn?</h2><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=575 data-injectable=true>These criteria were/are: Freshness, Saltiness, Crunchiness, Butter, and Presentation. Let’s call them the… Starting five? Come on people, a pun like that was a layup. BOOM, got you again. I’m on fire. BANG. Another one. Okay, I’ll stop. Apologies. Where was I?</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=127 data-injectable=false>If you want to see how your favorite NBA stadiums stack up, take a look at this detailed chart courtesy of The New York Times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/STEPHSTADIUMCORNRANKINGSpng.png><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>Kudos to the Dallas Mavericks for taking the top spot. Hats off to all around. Now as far as the Lakers and Clippers are concerned? Step it up folks. A two on freshness? One on saltiness? Those are the most important aspects of any good popcorn experience. How dare they?</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Honestly, I’m looking at this list and it seems pretty darn fair. More than that — it’s thought-out. Steph didn’t just throw the Golden State Warriors at the top for the hell of it. No. He actually ranked them lower than I’d have expected. Game respects game, and if anything else, Steph Curry knows when something is good.</p><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>Interestingly enough, during his time on Hot Ones Steph did mention that after his rankings came out, all of the NBA arena stepped their popcorn game up. So for all you fans out there that have been noticing a serious uptick in quality across the board, you have one Wardell Stephen Curry II to thank for that. Thanks, Steph. Don’t you ever change.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZpirnV2owaa8x2aarqqirsBuvM6pmqiqnmK%2ForrKoqWgq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
