Kardashian became a member of Simpson’s defense team after he was charged with the killings. He stood by Simpson during his 1995 trial, but the pair later fell out with each other after Simpson’s acquittal. Kardashian died in 2003.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Robert George Kardashian<br>BORN: February 22, 1944<br>BIRTHPLACE: Los Angeles, CA<br>DEATH: September 30, 2003<br>SPOUSE: Ellen Pierson (m. 2003–2003), Jan Ashley (m. 1998–1999), Kris Jenner (m. 1978–1991)<br>CHILDREN: Rob Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian</p><h2 data-node-id=6 title="Early Life and Family" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-family class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Family</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born on February 22, 1944, Robert Kardashian was the son of Armenian-American parents who had a successful meat-packing company. Kardashian grew up in Los Angeles where he attended Dorsey High School. He then earned a degree in business administration from the University of Southern California in 1966. Kardashian went on to earn a law degree from the University of San Diego.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For nearly a decade, Kardashian worked as a lawyer. He soon switched his focus to business. Kardashian, along with his brother and another investor, started up Radio & Records, a trade publication, in 1973. Around this time, he met and befriended football star O.J. Simpson. The pair started up a frozen yogurt shop and later a music video company together. Their families were also close. Kardashian married his first wife <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kris-jenner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kris class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kris</a> in 1978, and the couple soon welcomed daughter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kourtney-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kourtney class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kourtney</a> in 1979 and daughter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/kim-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Kimberly class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Kimberly</a> in 1980. The Kardashians spent time with Simpson and his then-girlfriend Nicole Brown (the pair later married in 1985). Soon the Kardashian family grew to include daughter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/khloe-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Khloe class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Khloe</a> and son <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/rob-kardashian data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Jr." class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Robert Jr.</a></p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Lawyer for O.J.

Simpson</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kardashian proved to be a loyal friend to Simpson in 1994 in the wake of the murder of his ex-wife and her friend Ron Goldman. He was by Simpson’s side in the days after these killings took place, letting him stay in his home. Kardashian was also seen taking away a piece of Louis Vuitton luggage from Simpson’s estate that some believe may have contained crucial evidence against Simpson. He was thrust into the national spotlight after Simpson refused to turn himself into the police, choosing instead to flee with a friend. Kardashian read a letter from Simpson, which many took to be a suicide note, during a press conference held by lawyer Robert Shapiro, who represented Simpson.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Simpson was captured after a televised police chase and eventually brought to trial in 1995 for the two murders. Kardashian, then a full-time businessman, got his legal credentials reinstated to become a member of Simpson’s “Dream Team” of lawyers, which also included Shapiro, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/johnnie-cochran data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Johnnie Cochran" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Johnnie Cochran</a> and F. Lee Bailey. He and the rest of Simpson's lawyers faced off against prosecutors <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/legal-figures/marcia-clark data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marcia Clark" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Marcia Clark</a> and Christopher Darden during the prolonged trial. Month after month, Kardashian was a constant support to Simpson. The jury acquitted Simpson of the murder charges that October.</p><img alt="robert kardashian and oj simpson sit at a table and look at a man in the lower left corner of the frame, both kardashian and simpson wear gray suits with light colored shirts and ties" title="Robert Kardashian and O.J.

Trial</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The close bond between Kardashian and Simpson eventually frayed. In 1996, Kardashian told ABC News that he had doubts over Simpson’s innocence. He said that “The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.'' Kardashian also was interviewed by author Larry Schiller for his book American Tragedy, which examined Simpson’s trial and defense team.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Divorced from his wife Kris in 1991, Kardashian married two more times. He and his third wife Ellen Pierson tied the knot in 2003, shortly after Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Kardashian died only weeks later on September 30, 2003, at his Los Angeles home. He was 59 years old.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2016, the television series, American Crime Story: People v. O.J.
