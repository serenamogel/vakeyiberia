Demi Lovato is always adding to her collection of ink, and her latest might just be her most unique one yet. According to her Instagram story, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Demi Lovato got a lion tattooed on her hand</a> that you need to see. It might seem like a random inking, but her biggest fans will know why it makes perfect sense.</p><p>It's official; <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lovato now has over 20 tattoos</a>. Each one is a little bit different, but her latest is in the most unconventional spot — her hand! The singer showed off her latest design on her Instagram story, and looked super excited about the new addition. The hand ink is a black and white lion that takes up her entire left hand. It fits right into the cross tattoo that was already there.</p><p>According to her Instagram story, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lovato got her tattoo at Bang Bang in New York</a>. She took a selfie with her tattoo artist and the new ink, so I think it's safe to say that she's pretty darn excited about her decision. Although the star didn't show the needle going into her skin on social media (big thanks for that, BTW), I'd say that this ink is real and here to stay.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>The signer didn't say exactly why she decided to get the animal on her hand, but the design won't surprise her biggest fans. Lovato has a song called <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lionheart that she released in 2015</a>. Although it was a while ago, this could be the inspiration behind the tat. As you can already tell, the singer is very open about her tattoos, so I'm willing to bet she'll tell her fans about the exact reason soon.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Like I said before, this take Lovato's tattoo count to over 20. She has everything from <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>quotes and Roman numerals on her side</a> to birds on her arms. This isn't her biggest inking, but it is one of the most visible thus far. Something tells me that this won't be the last tattoo that the star gets, either.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>It's always interesting to see what tattoos celebrities get, but it's even better when they show them off on their social media. I can't wait to see what Lovato gets next!</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jp2cpqFdoby3rdOoqmamlax6qa3NnWStmaSpvLB51qilrWWjqr%2BxvsisnGaglad6o7XGoJysrF2brq%2B%2FjG5qcHBj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
