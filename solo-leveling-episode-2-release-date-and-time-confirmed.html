After all, just because you love a story on paper doesn’t necessarily mean that you will love seeing it animated. We’ve had plenty of lackluster adaptations over the years, but fans were hopeful that Solo Leveling would stand out positively.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>The anime was quickly deemed one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most highly anticipated releases of 2024</a>, and now, with the first episode out, they can judge whether or not the wait was worth it. Truth be told, though, a single episode isn’t enough to properly evaluate if A-1 Pictures did a good job of adapting Sung Jin-woo’s story, thus, it’s only natural for viewers to need more. So, when will they get it?</p><h2 id=h-when-does-solo-leveling-episode-2-come-out data-injectable=false>When does Solo Leveling episode 2 come out?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>If you enjoyed the first episode of Solo Leveling and want to see more, you’re in luck. The anime is on a weekly release schedule, which means that you can expect episode 2 to drop on Saturday, Jan. 13. At the time of writing, an exact release time hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s safe to say that the episode <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be made available to stream</a> a few hours after it premieres in Japan. And if episode 1 is anything to go by, then 9:30 am PT is the most likely time for the streaming release.</p><p data-characters=189 data-current-count=189 data-injectable=false>If the Solo Leveling anime remains faithful to its source material, we have an interesting road ahead. Make sure to keep up with the episode releases so you don’t miss out on the fun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6spqWnXaGyt7HLoqWgZZWltrS7w55ka2WimrmmrdKeZJ2ZpJp6orrDZquipZVisLC6xaKppp2UZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
