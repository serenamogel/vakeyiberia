As she grew into adolescence in front of TV cameras, Jackson subsequently suffered psychological blowback. "They would put gauze around my chest to make me smaller, and I think that has an effect on you," Jackson said. "As if who you are isn't good enough."</p><p>As an adult, Jackson's body image issues manifested as an eating disorder. "Food has always brought me comfort and the binging is triggered when I'm in a space that is not positive," she told <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>The Telegraph</a>. "Maybe something happened and I'm feeling depressed, I eat to fill that void. Afterwards I'll beat myself up about it." Additionally, according to the <a href=# data-unsp-sanitized=clean>New York Daily News</a>, Jackson adopted patterns of bulimia and anorexia. "I had swung so far in one direction ... I never thought I could swing so far in the other," Jackson said. "You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more." She said that people around her had been able to tell when something was wrong, and she's learned to keep an open mind to those words.</p><p>If you are struggling with an eating disorder, or know someone who is, help is available.
